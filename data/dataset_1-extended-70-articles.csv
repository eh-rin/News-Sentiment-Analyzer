1,Blue economy and development in Sabah and its challenges,"As we move towards a more sustainable economic model, the Blue Economy has emerged as a key pillar for economic diversification and environmentalconservation. Sabah has vast coastline, rich marine biodiversity, and strategic location in the South China Sea, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this economic shift. The Blue Economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources to promote economic growth, enhance livelihoods, and ensure marine ecosystem health. It encompasses various sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, marine tourism, maritime transport, renewable energy, and marine biotechnology. Given Sabah’s abundant marine resources and coastal industries, the Blue Economy offers a strategic opportunity for long-term economic prosperity. However, significant challenges and issues hinder the development of Sabah’s Blue Economy, including climate change, pollution, overfishing, weak infrastructure, and regulatory gaps. Addressing these obstacles requires collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, research institutions, and local communities. One of the most critical stakeholders in advancing the Blue Economy is the engineering sector. Engineers play a vital role in infrastructure development, technology innovation, and environmental management, ensuring that ocean-based industries grow sustainably. ",en

3,Saving our forests for the future,"The Covid-19 crisis is believed to have opened the door for radical changes that are essential to safeguard our forests and help prevent the next pandemic. Tropical forest regions that experience land-use change are more prone to forest loss and if this is allowed to continue, prevention of future pandemics may not be a realistic option. Our approach to forests, therefore, has to change for the better, and as governments create policies to address the economic and social impacts of the global pandemic, there is an equally pressing need to confront issues of over-consumption and put greater value on health and nature. This is humanity’s best interests. As part of its efforts to bring to light the seriousness of forest loss, WWF recently launched the ‘Deforestation fronts: Drivers and responses in a changing world’ report which provides an in-depth analysis of deforestation hotspots. Referred to as deforestation fronts in the report, these hotspots are remaining parts of large forests of global importance that are under threat. The report reveals that an area roughly twice the size of the UK was lost to deforestation globally in just over a decade. While Borneo is among the 24 countries identified as a deforestation hotspot in the report, it is crucial to know that the numbers attributed to Borneo in the report represent the summation of forest loss in both tropical Indonesia Borneo and tropical Malaysia Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak).",en

23,APS: Why the Tenom logging approval?,"Angkatan Perpaduan Sabah (APS) queries the logging approval given by the Natural Resources Department, Land and Survey Department and the State Chief Conservator of Forests to a company involving 388.3 hectares in Kg Katubu Sasagop and Kg Kapulu. 
Its Vice President Paul Kadau said the people in the area wondered why the approval was given when the Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal last year said that anything that harms the environment will not be allowed even though it brings revenue to the State.  
He cited a statement by Shafie in May 28 last year that although logging concessionaires may be contributors to the State revenue, it cannot be allowed if it causes environment issues in Sabah. 
Kadau said APS believes that continued logging activities in the area will threaten the natural environment ecosystem which may cause erosion in the long run if left unaddressed. Among issues that the villagers disagreed with include Kg Imahit customary land boundary, water catchment area, effect on the tagal system in the river, and possible destruction of the community forest. 
They also claimed that it may also affect the old cemetery, daily lives of the indigenous community, geographical landscape of the land such as hills and existing rivers, destroy their crops and tagal system under the small grants programme. 
“The area is part of the Rundum Highland tourist area which is gaining popularity among tourists,” he said, recently. 
It is understood that the Kemabong State Constituency also sent a letter of protest to the Tenom District Officer who is also the Land Revenue Assistant Collector. 
This prompted an integrated inspection at the site on Wednesday, led by the Tenom District Officer and various government departments and agencies. 
Among those involved are those from the police, Keningau Road Transport Department, Sabah Environmental Protection Department, Sabah Environmental Department, Commercial Licensing Vehicle Board, Immigration Department, Kemabong Assistant District Officer and Rela, among others. 
The Tenom District Officer took action in stopping logging activities in the area based on issues concerning environmental protection and safety of the local community. 
APS described the action taken by the District Officer as accurate as it is in the interest of the people. ",en
24,Green practices must for all councils: Limus,"All local authorities (PBTs) in Sabah are encouraged to practice environmental sustainability through adoption of green practices in every development projects in their respective districts.
Assistant Minister of Works, Datuk Limus Jury, said this effort including reduce negative impacts to the earth through green practices, aims to preserve natural resources while emphasising the concept of a sustainable circular economy.
He said this is also in line with PBTs as the backbone and key indicators in implementing programmes or projects that focus on achieving sustainable landscape development.
“KKTP is actively working to strengthen and sustain every planning initiative, including landscape planning, in the pursuit of sustainable development,” Limus said. “Therefore, PBTs must also support the efforts of KKTP which serves as the driver and catalyst in formulating the State’s guidelines and direction, as well as in coordinating more organised and high-quality landscape development.” He said this when officiating an I-Hijau Roadshow Program (KKTP Green Initiative, Sabah Maju Jaya Aspiration) 2025, organised by KKTP and Kuala Penyu District Council held at Dato’ Syahbandar Makang hall, here, recently.
The programme serves as a platform that involves the entire community of Kuala Penyu in taking collective action to preserve the sustainability of their surrounding landscape. 
In this regard, the I-Hijau KKTP programme, serves as a platform and catalyst for green initiatives throughout the State and represent the Ministry’s ongoing efforts to promote green practices.
It began with the “I-Hijau KKTP” Festival in 2023 and KKTP approved the I-Hijau KKTP Roadshow, to be brought to Kuala Penyu for the first time and after this, the roadshow will continue to be held in Tenom. 
Limus, who is also Kuala Penyu Assemblyman, said there are five key principles in implementing a sustainable circular economy that they can work towards:
Efficient Use of Resources – to prevent waste and maximize the reuse and recycling of materials.
Carbon Footprint Reduction – to lower carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.
Development of a Social and Inclusive Economy – by prioritising human well-being.
Environmental Sustainability – aligned with the goals of a circular economy and aimed at preserving the natural environment.
Advancement of Green Technology and Innovation – to support sustainability through the adoption of environmentally friendly and innovative technologies.
In addressing climate change, Limus said the community must work together to implement environmental sustainability efforts in an integrated and balanced manner.
“This responsibility must be shouldered by all quarters to ensure the sustainability of both current and future generations.
“We believe that the key to resolving the climate crisis lies in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and transforming society to safeguard the environment,” he said.
Following this, Limus called on all residents here to embrace positive values to ensure the sustainability and preservation of the district. 
He said the habit of throwing garbage and waste from vehicles onto the road must be curbed and completely eliminated.
“Cleanliness and preserving the beauty of the local environment aligns with the district’s vision and its transformation into a new tourism hub in the country. 
“We must work hand-in-hand – especially community leaders and the people – to support the implementation of the Kuala Penyu Sustainable Village Programme, which was launched by the KKTP Minister Datuk Seri Dr Joachim Gunsalam on Nov 23 last year, at the Monsoi Point. 
“This programme, introduced by the Kuala Penyu District Council, is an excellent initiative to help guide the community in managing natural resources holistically and to foster village development in the social and economic spheres – ultimately creating a sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous community,” he said.
Therefore, Limus described the implementation of the I-Hijau 2025 Roadshow Program as highly appropriate, serving as a catalyst for the community – particularly in Kuala Penyu – to progress toward becoming a liveable and sustainable society, in line with KKTP’s vision: “Driving Sustainable Development and Achieving Community Well-being.”
Also present were Kuala Penyu District Officer Nelson Domil Oluk, KKTP Principal Assistant Secretary (Landscape) Nurulhayati Awang More, Kuala Penyu District Council Executive Officer John Genchit, who also chairs the District-Level Implementation Committee, along with executive officers from local authorities across the State, department heads, representatives from various government agencies, and community leaders.",en
25,Renewable Energy Certs an option: Expert,"Sabah’s clean energy transition is not only benefiting the environment but could also create new economic opportunities through carbon credits and renewable energy certificates, according to electrical engineer, Nirinder Singh Johl. 
“With the second-lowest carbon emissions from electricity in Malaysia, Sabah is well-positioned to capitalise on its cleaner energy mix, particularly as global businesses increasingly look to reduce their carbon footprint,” he said at the at the inaugural Sabah Renewable Energy Conference 2025’s Panel Session 2 titled Overcoming Hurdles and Transforming Tomorrow: Sabah’s Renewable Energy Transition Strategies.
“There has been a new standard on carbon credits for grid-connected energy storage. Probably Sabah could explore that,” he said, adding that it gives a bit of financial sense to having storage.
The Asia CarbonX Change PLT Chief Executive Officer pointed out Sabah’s environmental advantage, noting the significant difference in carbon emissions compared to Peninsular Malaysia. “Peninsula is 0.75 tons of CO2 per megawatt. We do not have coal here. We took a chance, a stand some time ago as a result of which the grid emission factor of Sabah is 0.55 and Sarawak obviously lowest, 0.19,” he said.
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) represent another opportunity for funding clean energy projects in the State. 
Nirinder described these as the block chain for the green market.
“Every time you generate one megawatt hour, you stop conventional energy production with the same amount. The one from renewable does not have carbon in it. 
“REC is basically the currency for the renewable energy market,” he said. 
For Sabah to fully participate in this market, he suggested developing a local certification system.
“If Sabah wants to go, probably Sabah needs to have an issuer, a Sabah issuer or probably in Malaysia, we call it M-VAX. We call it S-VAX for Sabah issuer. This is how you brand yourself,” he said.
He said the financial incentives are substantial, with RECs commanding different prices depending on market maturity and regulatory requirements.
“Solar RECs in Peninsular Malaysia cost USD5, while in Singapore they command USD65 due to their carbon market and compliance requirements.
“When taxation comes in here, the prices of RECs will go up, making it perfect sense to include in your financial model,” he said. 
Among his recommendations for Sabah’s renewable energy development was aligning power purchase agreements with the actual lifespan of energy plants.
“If the economic life of a solar plant is 25 years, give them 25 years. A hydro is 32 years, then give them 33 years,” he said.
Meanwhile, Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad Sector Head of Industry Partnership Nazliyah Mohd Ali said the expansion of renewable energy is also creating demand for workers with specialised skills.
“Last year, we conducted 10 sectors of impact study for Artificial Intelligence, digital and green economy to understand what the impact to the Malaysian workforce is,” she said. 
“Based on the findings, we understand that there is a need for energy-related skills like energy economists, energy traders, all those things are moving forward for the next three to five years. 
“Based on the National Energy Transition Roadmap, we know that there are a need for 62,000 professionals in green technology, green field,” she said.
To bridge the skills gap, TalentCorp has come up with the MyMahir Future Skills Talent Council and developed tailored programs.
“We developed curated programs, which are very much according to what industry wants. We want to see what the skills gap from the fresh graduate are and see what we can do to fit in the gap in terms of the skills,” she said. 
For those interested in exploring these career paths, she pointed to available resources online.
“This study, the impact study is actually available online. You can go to mymahir.my and you can actually download this copy.
“We have another separate platform for secondary and primary schools. If you have children, you can go to our platform and they can see interactive videos to understand what is actually done in layman terms for them to learn,” she said.

27,Mitigating climate change impact in Sabah,"THE Sabah Government is taking proactive steps to address climate change and global warming challenges with the establishment of the Sabah Climate Action Council (SCAC) and significant funding for mitigation and adaptation initiatives.
The Council, chaired by the State Secretary, plays a crucial role in setting the direction and coordinating mitigation and adaptation projects across Sabah.
Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor said a Climate Change Unit has also been set up within the Sabah Forestry Department as the Interim Secretariat for the SCAC, since forestry plays a key role in climate change management under the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) sector, specifically in Land Use, Land Use Change & Forestry (LULUCF).
The State Government has allocated RM3 million per year to the Climate Change Unit for implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives. 
“In 2024, the unit focused on two key components: the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory and a study on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation in Sabah,” said Hajiji.
“These components must be implemented urgently, as they serve as the foundation for Sabah’s climate change policy and carbon trading framework. It is also crucial for assessing the feasibility of carbon-related projects in the State,” he said.
Since its setting up in 2022, the SCAC is tasked with overseeing all climate-related initiatives in Sabah. At the 4th SCAC meeting on Aug 2, 2024, a Technical Working Group (TWG) on Vulnerability and Adaptation was proposed, led by the Sabah Tourism, Culture and Environment Ministry.
Hajiji highlighted that Sabah successfully completed consultancy services for the development of the Sabah Climate Change Policy in July 2024. This policy specifically focuses on two core components – Development of Sabah’s GHG Inventory and Study on the Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change in Sabah.
“The Sabah Government remains committed to strengthening resilience against climate change. By ensuring strategic planning, dedicated funding and inter-agency cooperation, we are positioning Sabah to better manage and mitigate the effects of climate change,” he said.
Asked on the SCAC’s recommendations to the Sabah Government, Hajiji said the SCAC has actively engaged in discussions regarding the impacts of climate change in Sabah since inception in 2022. 
“Matters related to the vulnerability, impacts and adaptation of climate change in Sabah were discussed in detail during the SCAC’s first meeting in 2022,” he said. “These discussions were an integral part of a comprehensive study conducted by Aurecon Lestari Sdn Bhd, which has recently been completed.”
A Cabinet Paper outlining actions based on the consultancy’s findings and recommendations is being prepared by the SCAC Secretariat.
Additionally, he highlighted that the Natural Resource Office (NRO) is working on a separate Cabinet Paper focused on the institutional setup and governance of the Climate Change Division within the NRO, as proposed during the fourth SCAC meeting.
“Furthermore, we are establishing other Technical Working Groups (TWGs) that will address climate change issues in Sabah, including those related to Communication, Educationa and Public Awareness (CEPA) and technology,” he said.
On the achievements made in Sabah’s green initiatives under the Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ) Development Plan, the Chief Minister said green sustainability refers to the responsible use and management of Sabah’s natural resources, ensuring that “we meet current needs while allowing future generations to do the same.” 
Hajiji emphasised the importance of integrating environmental protection with human development, particularly in the forestry sector. 
He highlighted significant strides Sabah has made in sustainable forestry.
“Our conservation programmes, sustainable forestry initiatives and community development projects are clear evidence of our commitment to sustainability. However, our journey does not end here; we must continue to innovate, adapt and strive for excellence in our practices.”
He said key achievements include:
Sabah’s 2nd Strategic Action Plan (SPA): Launched at the first Heart of Borneo (HoB) Symposium in 2022, this plan serves as a comprehensive roadmap to tackle environmental challenges, promote sustainable land use and support biodiversity conservation in the HoB region.
Forest Plantation Development Action Plan (2022-2036): This long-term master plan aims to ensure a sustainable timber supply for the wood industry while enhancing the quality and productivity of forest plantations, ultimately fostering economic growth alongside natural forest preservation.
Sabah Climate Action Council (SCAC): With the Sabah Forestry Department appointed as the Secretariat, this council is tasked with coordinating efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, integrating forestry within broader climate response strategies.
Sabah 25-Year Master Plan: Currently in its finalisation stages, this comprehensive plan will guide the long-term objectives of the Sabah Forestry Department, focusing on sustainable resource management and socioeconomic growth.
Sabah Mangrove Action Plan (SMAP): Launched at the Sabah International Blue Economy Conference (SIBEC) 2024, SMAP aims to guide the planning and management of mangrove forests, underscoring Sabah’s dedication to coastal protection, biodiversity and carbon sequestration.
Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ) Plan: Sustainability is a central element of the Green Infrastructure Network and Sustainability Pillar included in this plan.
Looking ahead, Hajiji said Sabah aims to expand reforestation efforts, incorporate advanced technology in forest management and strengthen international collaborations. 
“Through the Sabah Forestry Department, we are determined to develop a resilient and sustainable forestry sector that not only meets today’s needs but also protects resources for future generations,” he said. 
Forests as lifeline for future generations
SABAH remains committed to preserving its forests and planting more trees as part of its ongoing efforts to minimise the impact of global warming. 
CM Hajiji reiterated the Sabah Government’s dedication to maintaining forest conservation policies, recognising the crucial role forests play in climate mitigation.
“Sabah will continue its policy of maintaining and expanding forested areas while implementing tree-planting initiatives to combat the effects of climate change. Our forests are among our greatest assets, and we must protect them for future generations,” he said.",en
28,Sabah Forestry and French group to collaborate on agroforestry research deal,"Sabah Forestry Department (SFD) and the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) have signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) to formalise a collaborative partnership on TRAILS 2, a long-term agroforestry research initiative aimed at transforming oil palm landscapes to support both biodiversity and sustainable productivity.
TRAILS 2, short for Agroforestry Plantations for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, represents an ambitious step toward reconciling environmental conservation with agricultural development. 
The project seeks to assess innovative oil palm-based agroforestry systems that integrate native tree species, improve ecological connectivity, and deliver critical ecosystem services such as soil fertility, microclimate regulation, and habitat provision for wildlife. 
The study site is at Melangking Oil Palm Plantation in Sukau, where the company has set aside some 100 ha for this biodiversity research. The LoI, signed at SFD Headquarters in Sandakan, reflects a shared commitment to addressing pressing global challenges—deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change—through science-based approaches tailored to tropical ecosystems. It also paves the way for more resilient land management practices in the face of increasingly unsustainable monoculture plantation models.
As part of the collaboration, SFD will facilitate coordination with key regulatory agencies, such as the Sabah Biodiversity Centre and the Department of Agriculture to ensure the TRAILS 2 project aligns with local and national legal frameworks. 
In addition, the Forest Research Centre Sepilok, the research arm of SFD, will provide technical guidance and support in forest ecology and long-term monitoring. In addition, CIRAD is also working with HUTAN, an NGO led by Dr Marc Ancrenaz on wildlife monitoring.
Datuk Frederick Kugan, Chief Conservator of Forests, represented by Indra Sunjoto, Deputy Chief Conservator of Forests (Planning & Management), stated this partnership with CIRAD reinforces Sabah’s leadership in sustainable forestry.
TRAILS 2 opens new opportunities to demonstrate that oil palm production and biodiversity conservation can co-exist through thoughtful land-use innovation.
While Professor Alain Rival, representing Dr Jean Marc Roda, the CIRAD Regional Director for Southeast Asian Island Countries, commented, with TRAILS 2, they want to move beyond debate and put our research and development partnership into action. 
Long-term field experiments and accurate monitoring are essential to build scientific evidence for sustainable agroforestry, especially in complex landscapes such as Sabah.
The research will explore multiple agroforestry configurations—from interplanted native tree rows to forest islands embedded within plantations—while monitoring their effects on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and palm productivity. 
Findings from TRAILS 2 are expected to provide robust data to guide growers, policymakers, and conservationists toward regenerative oil palm-based systems.",en
29,Firm’s bid to restore mangroves,"A total of 300 mangrove saplings were planted at Sankina Aquaculture Sdn Bhd’s shrimp farm in Apas Parit under a joint environmental initiative to restore coastal ecosystems and enhance biodiversity.
The programme involved the planting of 200 mangrove saplings of bakau api-api (Avicennia alba) sourced from nearby mangrove areas and 100 mangrove saplings of bakau minyak (Rhizophora apiculata) donated by Tawau District Forestry Office aiming to restore coastal ecosystems and enhance biodiversity. 
This effort builds upon Sankina’s ongoing environmental initiatives, including a similar programme in 2023 in collaboration with Politeknik Sandakan and WWF-Malaysia, where 150 mangrove saplings were planted to promote awareness of mangrove conservation among students and the local community.
The programme is a collaborative initiative between Sankina Aquaculture Sdn Bhd and Nichirei Fresh Inc, a core subsidiary of the Nichirei Group, which stands at the forefront of Japan’s premium food industry.

31,How thermal energy can unlock Sabah’s economic potential,"The recent enactment of the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) law by the Sabah Legislative Assembly marks a pivotal step towards sustainable development.
Beyond generating renewable energy, OTEC technology offers a multitude of benefits that can significantly enhance Sabah’s economy and the well-being of its people.
Desalinated Water Production
Otec systems inherently produce fresh water as a byproduct, addressing water scarcity issues prevalent in many regions. This desalinated water can support agriculture, provide potable water to communities, and reduce reliance on traditional, energy-intensive desalination methods.
Aquaculture Enhancement
The nutrient-rich deep ocean/sea water (DOW) used in OTEC processes can be channelled into aquaculture, fostering the cultivation of high-value marine species.
This not only boosts local food production but also creates employment opportunities in fisheries and related industries.
Agricultural Productivity
Soil cooling systems can utilize DOW’s cool temperatures to cultivate temperate crops in tropical climates. This diversification can lead to increased agricultural yields and the introduction of new crops to the market, benefiting local farmers and consumers alike.
Tourism Development
Integrating OTEC facilities with tourism can create unique attractions, such as spas and wellness centres that use the mineral-rich DOW.  This can attract tourists seeking novel experiences, thereby boosting the local tourism industry and generating additional revenue.
Air Conditioning Efficiency
District cooling systems can use the cold seawater from Otec systems as an energy-efficient alternative to air conditioning in urban areas.
This reduces electricity consumption and operational costs, contributing to more sustainable urban development.
Green hydrogen production.
Otec technology facilitates the production of green hydrogen, a clean fuel with applications in various industries, including transportation and manufacturing.
Developing a green hydrogen economy can position Sabah as a leader in renewable energy innovation.
Environmental Conservation
By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, Otec contributes to lower greenhouse gas emissions, aiding in the fight against climate change. Additionally, the sustainable use of ocean resources promotes marine conservation efforts.
Educational and research opportunities.
The implementation of Otec projects can serve as a platform for scientific research and education, fostering innovation and knowledge transfer.
Collaborations with academic institutions can lead to advancements in marine sciences and renewable energy technologies.
Community Empowerment
Participating local communities in Otec projects guarantees the equitable distribution of benefits.
Capacity-building initiatives can equip residents with the skills needed to participate in and sustain these projects, promoting inclusive development.
Economic Diversification
The multifaceted applications of Otec technology can stimulate various sectors, from agriculture to tourism, leading to a more resilient and diversified economy.
This reduces dependence on traditional industries and opens new avenues for growth.
Human resource development and technology transfer.
The adoption of OTEC technology necessitates special skills and knowledge, prompting the development of targeted educational and training programs.
The emphasis on human resource development equips the local workforce to manage and operate OTEC facilities, promoting a culture of innovation and technical proficiency.
Collaborations with international experts facilitate the transfer of technology, enabling Sabah to build local expertise and reduce dependence on external resources.
Upstream and downstream business opportunities.
Otec technology stimulates a spectrum of business opportunities. Upstream activities include research and development, engineering, and manufacturing of OTEC components, which can invigorate local industries and create high-skilled jobs.
Downstream, the benefits extend to sectors such as agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, and water supply, all of which can leverage the outputs of Otec systems to enhance their operations and services. This integrated approach fosters a robust economic ecosystem, driving sustainable development across the state.
Otec law represents a transformative opportunity for Sabah. By harnessing the ocean’s thermal energy, the state can unlock a spectrum of benefits that drive economic growth, environmental sustainability and social well-being. 
Strategic planning and community involvement will be crucial in realising the full potential of OTEC technology, paving the way for a prosperous and sustainable future for Sabah.",en
32,Nearly 300km Sabah’s coast under assault,"ACCORDING to Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), some 295.5km of Sabah’s 1,743km coastline is in danger of being lost to the sea. 
Among these, 12.8km have been classified as critical (Category 1), 3.5km as significant (Category 2), and 279.2km as acceptable (Category 3).
This was based on the National Coastal Erosion Study in 1985 conducted by the Federal Government to classify and mitigate erosion-prone areas.
Recognising the threats, the National Coastal Erosion Council requested the Federal Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in 1995 to develop guidelines for erosion control in development projects. 
This led to the formulation of the “Guidelines on Erosion Control for Development Projects in the Coastal Zone”, which received Federal Cabinet approval on January 29, 1997, for implementation.
The Sabah Government prioritises minimising negative environmental impacts from marine reclamation projects while ensuring socioeconomic benefits within a sustainable framework. 
To achieve this, the Sabah Environment, Tourism Development, Science and Technology Ministry, in collaboration with DID and the Town and Regional Planning Department (TRPD), implemented an overarching Shoreline Management Plan (SMP). 
This plan designates areas for development and conservation along the West Coast, stretching from Ambong Bay in the North to Menggalong River in the South.
To further standardise environmental safeguards, Terms of Reference (TOR) for Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment for Marine Reclamation were formulated to ensure Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) compliance for marine reclamation project approvals.
Additionally, supporting TORs for Environmental Monitoring and Management of Marine Reclamation projects provide guidelines for sustainable coastal development.
DID Sabah works closely with its Federal counterpart, for the planning and designing of coastal erosion control, river mouth improvement works and the cleaning of recreational beaches as well as collection and dissemination of data related to coastal engineering. DID Malaysia, with co-ordination from DID Sabah, has carried out three feasibility study projects by consultant for three areas namely Tinagat-Batu Puyong near Tawau, Tungku near Lahad Datu and Tanjong Aru-Kinarut coastal zone near Kota Kinabalu which are classified as Catergory 1 in Sabah.
DID Sabah is also working closely with other government departments/agencies involved in coastal zone management. 
Meanwhile, Malaysian Association of Environmental Health Secretary Rudiaswady Abdul Rahim in January 2024 raised concerns over the ongoing coastal erosion affecting Malaysia, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak. 
Overall, Malaysia’s 8,840km coastline faces significant challenges, with 1,347.6km affected by erosion and 431.3km classified as critical and significant.
Given that the data originates from 2015, Rudiaswady highlighted the urgent need for updated assessments. “We lack insights into the current state of coastal erosion.
But one thing is certain, it is deeply concerning that we may be losing our beautiful beaches,” he warned.
He urged the Government to conduct a comprehensive survey on coastal erosion and implement a holistic strategy incorporating nature-based solutions, hybrid strategies, early warning systems and investments in nature-based infrastructure to mitigate further damage.
Jellyfish blooms linked to climate change
CLIMATE change has altered the distribution patterns of sea turtles in Sabah, primarily due to rising sea temperatures, shifting ocean currents and habitat loss. 
Dr Madihah said recent observations in Sabah suggest possible shifts in hawksbill turtle nesting sites.
“For many years, hawksbills have primarily nested on Pulau Gulisaan in Turtle Islands Park (Sulu Sea). However, a hawksbill turtle with flipper tags from Turtle Islands Park was recently recorded nesting in Semporna (Celebes Sea). This raises important questions about whether some turtles are beginning to explore alternative nesting beaches. 
“This may be linked to habitat degradation, as severe erosion has impacted the main hawksbill nesting site in Turtle Islands Park, potentially forcing turtles to seek new nesting grounds,” she said.  
On a global scale, she said shifting nesting sites have already been documented as a response to climate change. Warmer temperatures are pushing certain species, such as leatherbacks, further north, and some nesting seasons are expanding. 
While extensive long-term monitoring is needed to confirm similar trends in Sabah, these local and global shifts highlight the need for conservation strategies to protect potential new nesting areas and enhance resilience against climate-driven habitat changes.
“There has also been an increase in the sighting and frequency of mass jellyfish blooms in Sabah’s waters, which could be an indicator of climate change,” she added.  Dr Madihah also noted changes in the composition, abundance and size of fish species in commercial landings, as evidenced by the Annual Fisheries Statistics (published by Sabah Fisheries Department) and personal field observations since the late 1990s. 
This ecological shift is known as “mesopredator release” where mesopredator populations increase due to the decline of apex predators, particularly large sharks and groupers.  
However, she explained that shifts in the distribution of key marine species due to climate change are not yet particularly evident. The dominant coral species in Sabah, Acropora and Porites, continue to thrive despite environmental changes, demonstrating their resilience compared to other more vulnerable species.  
Asked about the implications for local fisheries and communities dependent on these resources, Dr Madihah highlighted the impact of jellyfish blooms.  
“Jellyfish feed on plankton, including commercial fish larvae, which can lead to a decline in certain fishery stocks. Additionally, jellyfish blooms can clog fishing gear, causing operational challenges for fishermen. Their increasing frequency also affects marine tourism, particularly activities such as snorkelling and diving,” she explained.  
Despite these environmental changes, she emphasised that ongoing conservation efforts have led to an increase in Sabah’s sea turtle populations. As a result, their shifting distribution and climate-related changes do not yet have significant direct implications for local fisheries and communities. 
Tropical storms now lash Sabah
TROPICAL Storm Greg devastated the State in 1996, affecting over 17,000 people and destroying nearly 5,000 houses. While the direct marine impacts were not well documented at the time, Dr Madihah said “heavy rainfall and flooding likely contributed to increased sedimentation and pollution in coastal waters, harming marine habitats.”
Similarly, Tropical Storm Hilda in 1999 caused widespread flooding and landslides, particularly along the West Coast. Like Tropical Storm Greg, the heavy rainfall would have increased runoff into coastal areas, potentially harming marine habitats. 
“Rising sea levels and storms due to climate change is leading to more frequent and intense storms, which, combined with rising sea levels, exacerbate coastal erosion and threaten marine ecosystems in Sabah.” 
Countering fish catch decline
SABAH’S fishing communities are facing increasing challenges as fish population declines due to climate change, habitat degradation and overfishing. Experts warn that commercial reef fish such as grouper and snapper are becoming scarcer, particularly in non-protected reef areas.
“Based on information we get from the local fishing community, commercial reef fishes like grouper and snapper are reducing,” said Dr Madihah. 
The response has been to target ‘less favourable’ species. 
“For example, species that used to be not fish for food are now available in the fish market. These communities are finding alternative livelihoods to adapt to declining seagrass health.”
The Fisheries Department is implementing management strategies, including regulating fishing activities. One such is using satellite assistance called iivms to track shoals. 
More high biodiversity and ecological important areas would also be identified and gazetted as marine parks to regulated human activities and reduce impact to marine habitats and ecosystem services. 
“The establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) Sabah also allow seagrass and other marine life to recover.”",en
33,Students get insight on climate change,"Forty students gathered at the Rainforest Discovery Centre (RDC) in Sepilok for the Youth Camp on Climate Change 2025, held from April 30 to May 2.
The three-day camp, sponsored by the state’s Youth and Sports Ministry, was organised by the Sabah Forestry Department.
It brought together participants aged 17 to 25 from Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Politeknik Sandakan, Kolej Komuniti Sandakan, Kolej Vokasional Sandakan II and Kolej Komuniti Lahad Datu.
Participants were divided into smaller groups and assigned different climate-related topics, which they later presented during the final session of the camp. Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Ellron Angin said the ministry greatly appreciates the initiative in organising the meaningful camp.
“When we were informed that 40 youth from diverse backgrounds and areas of study would gather at the Rainforest Discovery Centre to explore the issue of climate change, we were confident that such programmes deserve our attention and support.
“Your presence here shows that Malaysian youth, especially in Sabah, are not only eager to gain knowledge but also ready to take concrete steps in addressing this challenge,” he said, represented by the Ministry’s Deputy Permanent Secretary Mary Paul Mijong Dagul.
In line with this hands-on approach, the camp included workshops conducted in collaboration with Sabah Environmental Education Network (Seen) partners such as the Sabah Wildlife Department and Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre (BSBCC).
Sabah Forestry Department Chief Conservator of Forests Datuk Frederick Kugan said it is hoped that the Youth Camp on Climate Change would serve as a catalyst for more climate-themed initiatives in the future, with the involvement of youth from all over Sabah.
He said it is truly impressive to learn that most of the participants in this camp are not from scientific backgrounds but are passionate to learn and understand climate change issues.
“We believe that the youth, as the heirs of the future, need to be given space to understand and be involved in efforts to address this issue.
“Climate change is not just an issue for experts but a concern that needs to be understood by everyone,” Frederick said, represented by Head of Forest Research Centre Dr Arthur Chung.
Participants were divided into smaller groups and assigned different climate-related topics, which they presented during the final session of the camp.",en
34,Pan Borneo poses threat to the Tawai forest reserve,"TOUTED as a game-changer, environmentalists and conservationists have raised serious concerns about the Pan Borneo Highway project’s potential impact such as plans to cut across the biodiversity-rich Tawai Forest Reserve on the East Coast.
A recent seminar by the Sabah Forestry Department, titled “Defining Tawai: Ecological Integrity Meets Social Values”, underscored the significance of the Tawai Forest Reserve as a crucial component of Sabah’s natural heritage. 
One of the key issues discussed was the Highway cutting through Ruku Ruku Valley – an ecologically sensitive area within the reserve and plea to the State Government to consider an alternative route.
Commenting on the issue, Frederick emphasised the risks of habitat fragmentation that would be caused by the highway.
“The Pan Borneo Highway’s route through Ruku Ruku Valley threatens vital wildlife habitats, endangering species that depend on large, connected landscapes, such as the Bornean elephant and the critically endangered Bornean peacock pheasant,” he said.
Experts fear the fragmentation could also escalate human-wildlife conflicts, disrupt key wildlife corridors and diminish the genetic diversity of species within the reserve. 
Concerns were also raised about increasing encroachment and plantation expansion by quarters seizing advantage of the situation.",en
35,Why SDG13 matters to Sabah Electricity,"Climate change isn’t a distant idea anymore. It is here, and it’s already reshaping how we live and work. 
When people talk about climate change, they often picture melting ice caps or rising sea levels in faraway places. But for us at Sabah Electricity, the effects of climate change are not distant or theoretical but they are right here, on our land, impacting our grid, damaging our infrastructure, and threatening our ability to serve the people of Sabah. 
That’s why we take Sustainable Development Goal (SDG13) dedicated to Climate Action seriously. Not because it’s trendy, or because we have to, but because we’ve seen what happens when nature strikes and we aren’t prepared.
The truth is, we need climate action not as a slogan, but as a survival strategy.
Over the past year alone, we’ve experienced first-hand how natural disasters can paralyze the electricity supply in Sabah. Remember the landslide in Kampung
Nabutan? That wasn’t just a normal landslide as it occurred right near the 275kV transmission towers that are part of the backbone of our grid. 
These towers connect the west coast and east coast of Sabah, carrying roughly 200 megawatts of electricity every day. If they had fallen, the entire east coast could have plunged into darkness. 
That’s not just a technical issue but also a disruption to homes, schools, clinics, and factories. That’s the real-world consequence of not acting fast enough to protect our infrastructure from the shifting earth beneath our feet.
The condition of those towers became very critical. There was no village nearby, no people around to help, just deep forest and unstable soil. And yet, 30 of our Sabah Electricity staff, 30 from TNB, and 20 contractors went deep into those high-risk areas to prevent collapse.
They knew the stakes. They knew that for every bolt tightened, every reinforcement made, they were protecting the daily lives of thousands across Sabah.
And what about the disaster in Tenom? On 31 October 2022, the Tenom Pangi Hydro Power Station, one of Sabah’s key sources of renewable energy was hit by a massive landslide and mud flood. Three turbines were damaged. We lost 66 megawatts of generation capacity overnight. 
That’s clean energy gone. That’s a dent in our generation portfolio. That’s power we could not deliver to the people. And again, nature didn’t wait for us to be ready. It came in full force.
These are not rare events anymore. They are becoming more frequent, more intense, and costlier. Toppled electric poles, broken distribution lines, flooded substations. Every time something like this happens, it puts our system under stress.
 And every time our system is under stress, the people of Sabah feel it, whether it’s in the form of a blackout, load shedding, or delayed restoration works. This is why SDG13 matters to us, not as a formality, but as a foundation of power stability and asset protection.
Here in this company, we see SDG13 as a lifeline. When we talk about “green initiatives,” we’re not just talking about planting trees or cutting carbon, we’re talking about investing in infrastructure that survives, about building systems that bend but don’t break, and about planning for a future where power is reliable, even in the face of floods, storms, and landslides.
These things are not luxuries, they’re necessities.
That’s why for us, SDG13 Climate Action isn’t just about protecting the environment. It’s about protecting our assets, our power system, and the lives and livelihoods of the people who count on us every day.
It’s easy to overlook how much the power grid depends on the land around it staying still and predictable. But the earth is moving, the rains are heavier, the storms are stronger. And Sabah’s geography, while beautiful, makes us even more vulnerable.
That’s why SESB isn’t sitting on the side-lines. We’re reinforcing our towers, upgrading our monitoring systems, and doing everything we can to build resilience into our grid.
But beyond the technical work, we also see the need to shift mindsets—ours, our partners’, and the public’s. Climate change isn’t just the responsibility of scientists and NGOs. It’s everyone’s problem. 
And in our case, it’s directly linked to whether homes have light, hospitals have power, and industries keep moving. If we want to keep the lights on, we have to care about the earth we’re standing on.
So yes, Sabah Electricity supports SDG13. Fully. Not because someone told us to, but because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t. The path forward means embracing sustainability in real, practical ways, not only for the environment but for the future of electricity in Sabah.",en
36,Sabah’s sustainable palm oil vision: Leading way for people and planet,"This regular op-ed column features WWF-Malaysia’s perspectives on pressing environmental issues and events unfolding in Sabah. As an environmental conservation NGO, we also use this space to share our views on potential policy shifts that Sabah’s leaders can implement to foster a greener and more sustainable future for the state.

Oil palm was first introduced to Malaya as an ornamental plant before 1875. Commercial planting began in 1917 in Selangor, and large-scale expansion of palm oil in Sabah took off in the 1970s. Throughout the country, the expansion was part of the government’s diversification strategy to reduce its reliance on rubber and timber. The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) and plantation companies were tasked to drive this expansion.
In Sabah, companies such as Sabah Softwoods Berhad started their first oil palm planting in the early 1980s. By 1998, the development of oil palm had reached more than 800,000 hectares. The industry has since grown to be a major economic force in the state. In 2023, Sabah became the largest crude palm oil (CPO) producing state in Malaysia, producing 4.5 million tonnes of crude palm oil (CPO) out of 1.5 million hectares of plantation area.

While generating economic revenue, the development of the palm oil industry has impacted Sabah’s rich biodiversity. In just over 15 years, between 2002 and 2017, land clearing and conversion of forest for palm oil production have reduced the population of orangutans by 30%. Recognising this, Sabah has shifted towards sustainability by emphasising the need for development to be amply balanced by biodiversity conservation. Rather than seeing the need for development and biodiversity conservation as conflicting priorities, Sabah has charted a bold path that unites them, showing that it is possible to protect forests and wildlife while cultivating prosperity. By embracing sustainability at scale, the state is emerging as a global leader in producing palm oil that works for both people and the planet.

Sabah has proven that palm oil production does not have to come at the expense of the environment. In fact, it can be a solution. The future lies not in choosing between forests or farms, but in making them work together.",en
37,Guardian of the rainforest’s biodiversity,"Sabah is a beacon of biodiversity, located within one of the mega-biodiversity hotspots in the world. It is the extraordinary diversity of habitats from mountain top to ocean deep that harbours such a vast wealth of flora and fauna. The flora of Sabah is one of the most notable natural features. The world’s tallest tropical tree, Richetia faguetiana, is found in Sabah, measuring 100.8 m in height. The world’s largest pitcher plant, Nepenthes rajah, is also found in Sabah. New species are still being discovered, such as Nepenthes pongoides, which was only discovered last year. Sabah is also home to about 10% of the world’s orchids and three species of the world’s largest flowers, Rafflesia. With the top three highest peaks in Malaysia and Borneo, the montane forests house many rare, interesting and endemic species. The natural ecosystems of Sabah support a vast diversity of wildlife. It is home to the iconic orang-utan, proboscis monkey, tembadau, pygmy elephant, sun bear, various interesting birds and a myriad of insects. Achieving SFM has been one of the main agendas of Sabah Forestry Department (SFD). As emphasized by the Chief Conservator of Forests, Datuk Frederick Kugan, biodiversity conservation is an important component in SFM in protecting the forest resources. Some notable milestones have been achieved, such as the establishment of Totally Protected Areas (TPAs), the Heart of Borneo (HoB) Initiative, the designation and management of the Lower Kinabatangan-Segama Wetlands (LKSW) as a Ramsar site, mangrove forest management and restoration, forest monitoring and enforcement, and forestry research in biodiversity conservation.",en

40,Empowering coastal communities for climate resilience and conservation,"The Sabah Community Environmental Leadership Camp (CELC) 2025, themed “Resilience Community & Ecosystems – Climate Change Adaptation”, has successfully concluded after an intensive eight-day program designed to empower 36 grassroots community leaders from 18 community-based organisation or coastal and island villages across Malaysia to lead for a change in their community.

Participants from Semporna, Tawau, Kunak, Lahad Datu, Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Kota Belud and Kudat, along with representatives from Redang and Tioman Islands in Peninsular Malaysia, underwent training to enhance their awareness of the climate change crisis affecting their homelands.

In addition to increasing their understanding of the issue, they also participated in brainstorming sessions to identify key challenges and develop potential solutions. The camp was officially inaugurated by the Assistant District Officer of Semporna, Hj Abdul Azis bin Abd Bool emphasized the crucial role of coastal communities in environmental stewardship.

“Climate change has a direct impact on the sea, and those living in coastal and island communities are the first to face its challenges. Hence, our coastal and island communities are on the frontlines of environmental change. Their leadership needs to be strengthened, there needs to be knowledge-sharing among them, and they need to be empowered to take action towards sustainable solutions. I am happy that the camp provides that and proud to see passionate individuals coming together to make a difference,” he said during the event.

Organized by Green Semporna and Reef Check Malaysia, with the support of Youth Environment Living Lab (YELL) and DHI Malaysia, the boot camp brought together experienced and well-known speakers from various institutions and organizations. These experts delivered insightful sessions on coastal and marine conservation, climate resilience, community leadership, and sustainable livelihood development. The camp also featured interactive activities to foster collaboration and hands-on learning.

This program includes community sharing, the impact of climate change on the environment and marine species, as well as the importance of conservation and resource management. There are sessions on community empowerment through economic initiatives, leadership, youth advocacy, and gender equality.

Participants are also introduced to resource mapping, art as a medium for advocacy, and digital communication. Interactive activities include simulation meetings, climate film production, IKLIM Got Talent, and conservation actions in Mabul.

The program concludes with project pitching where participants pitched their ideas to win the Sabah CELC Mini Grant 2025.

“The Sabah CELC is more than just a training camp – it’s a movement. We are empowering local champions with the skills, knowledge and networks they need to drive change within their communities. By supporting grassroots conservation efforts, we are creating a ripple effect for lasting impact,” said Adzmin Fatta, Program Lead for Sabah CELC 2025 & Programme Manager at Reef Check Malaysia.

One common challenge addressed by the participating communities is beach erosion caused by rising sea levels. This issue has severely impacted several coastal areas, leading to the destruction of numerous homes. Additionally, saltwater intrusion has made well water and groundwater increasingly saline, further affecting daily life and resources.

A key camp activity is Climate Action Day, a full-day citizen science event on Mabul Island. Participants work in groups to conduct seagrass monitoring, beach profiling, and water quality monitoring, while also engaging in coral reef restoration and community climate-stories filmmaking. This hands-on experience helps them develop practical skills to document and address environmental issues in their communities. It also deepens their appreciation for nature and raises awareness of the urgent threats posed by climate change.

“We need to integrate scientific knowledge with local wisdom to create effective, community-driven climate adaptation initiatives. This camp provides an excellent platform for such collaboration,” said Profesor Madya Ts. Dr. Ejria Saleh from Universiti Malaysia Sabah, who was one of the speakers during the camp.

“We can see the multi-fold benefits of initiatives like the CELC project; creating the opportunity for coastal communities to access leadership training and mini-grants facilitates building skills, confidence and resilience of the community to adapt to climate and environmental threats, but other emerging challenges,” said Lim Su Jin, Youth Environmental Living Labs Coordinator.

As part of the program’s commitment to long-term impact, 11 mini grants worth RM2,000 each were awarded to 11 winning teams during a project pitching session.

These grants will fund community-led conservation initiatives ranging from citizen science to livelihood projects to be implemented from April to August 2025.

“Grassroots leadership is at the heart of environmental conservation. It is inspiring to see these dedicated individuals taking ownership of their natural resources and working towards sustainable solutions,” said Nurasikin Jajim, the programme coordinator for Green Semporna.

“This camp has given me valuable skills and confidence to lead environmental initiatives back in my village. The connections I made here will help me strengthen community efforts in conservation,” said Abdul Rasyid, a participant from Selakan Island.

“I have gained so much from this experience – from project planning to advocacy skills. I look forward to implementing my ideas and inspiring others in my community,” said Intan Baljana, a participant from Kudat.

The Sabah Community Environmental Leadership Camp 2025 marks a crucial step in strengthening grassroots conservation leadership in Malaysia’s coastal regions. By equipping participants with knowledge, resources and networks, the initiative is fostering a new generation of community leaders dedicated to marine conservation and climate action.",en
41,Sabah aims to turn elephants from nuisance to tourism treasure,"Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Seri Christina Liew wants the perception of elephants being seen as a source of conflict and nuisance to be shifted to being recognised as an asset for the state’s tourism, environment and heritage.

Accordong to her, Sabah is home to the smallest elephant in the world, a species found nowhere else on Earth.

“While this unique trait makes them a valuable tourism asset, their existence is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.

“Today, as we gather to discuss and develop strategies for their conservation, we have an opportunity to ensure that future generations will continue to witness these gentle giants roaming our forests,” she said at the launch of the Captive Elephant Management Plan and Bornean Elephant Conservation Symposium on Wednesday.

“I believe the discussions being held in this symposium are vital in shaping the future of Bornean elephants. We need to strike a delicate balance — one that allows for both the welfare of our people in Sabah and the conservation of elephants to co-exist in harmony.

“We must aim for solutions where both communities and elephants benefit. We have seen successful examples of turning environmental challenges into opportunities.

“The transformation of sea turtle egg collection into a thriving hatchery-based tourism product is a prime example. Can we do the same for elephants? Can we shift the perception of elephants from being seen as a source of conflict and nuisance to being recognised as an asset to our tourism, environment and heritage?” she asked.

The reality is that human-elephant conflict exists. However Liew said instead of seeing it as a burden, all parties must explore ways to turn this challenge into a positive impact for local communities.

She added community-based conservation, ecotourism initiatives and compensation schemes are some avenues worth exploring.

“At the same time, we must strengthen enforcement to protect our elephants. Poaching and illegal killings must be met with strict prosecution to deter future offences.

“Snare traps, the ‘silent killer’ of our wildlife, must also be eradicated. This requires increased patrolling, active removal of traps, and harsher penalties for offenders.

“Only through decisive action and unwavering commitment can we ensure true protection for our wildlife, not just for Bornean elephant,” she added.

Liew also said that the Captive Elephant Management Plan represents a significant step forward in improving the standards of elephant care in Sabah. It is also one of the key outputs of the Bornean Elephant Action Plan, reinforcing commitment to ensure best ex-situ practices for elephant management and long-term conservation efforts.

“Our goal is clear — we want our captive facilities, such as the Bornean Elephant Sanctuary and Lok Kawi Wildlife Park, to be recognised internationally as centres of excellence.

“These facilities provide a haven for elephants that cannot be immediately released into the wild while also supporting rehabilitation and eventual reintroduction, particularly at the Bornean Elephant Sanctuary.

“They play a vital role in conservation education, research, and sustainable tourism. Proper training, resources, and recognition for elephant keeper are essential to their work.

“Investing in better infrastructure will enhance elephant welfare and elevate the tourism experience. A well-managed sanctuary and captive elephant centre will strengthen conservation efforts while boosting Sabah’s tourism appeal, attracting visitors eager to support ethical wildlife conservation,” she said.

With the implementation of the Captive Elephant Management Plan and the insights gained from this symposium, Liew is confident that Sabah’s efforts in Bornean elephant conservation will be taken to new heights.

By working together — government bodies, conservationists, NGOs and local communities, Liew believed all relevent parties can create a model of conservation that will be recognised internationally.

“Let this moment serve as a commitment that we will not allow the Bornean elephant to be pushed toward extinction. Instead, let us pledge to protect, preserve and co-exist with these magnificent creatures for generations to come,” she concluded.

Also present at the event were the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary Datuk Josie Lai; director of the Sabah Wildlife Department, Mohd Soffian Abu Bakar; Elephant Conservation Lead, Oregon Zoo, Dr Sharon S. Gleaser and president of Malaysian Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria (MAZPA), Dr Kevin Lazarus.",en
42,Transforming Sabah’s agricultural landscape through engineering,"Padi cultivation in Sabah
Sabah is blessed with rich biodiversity, fertile land, and high annual rainfall — conditions ideal for agriculture. Yet, like many regions balancing development with environmental and logistical challenges, Sabah remains partially reliant on imported food supplies. Currently, over 60% of its food — particularly rice, vegetables, and meat products — is sourced externally, leaving it exposed to supply chain disruptions and global price volatility.

However, this also presents an opportunity. By leveraging engineering innovation, systems thinking, and cross-sector collaboration, Sabah can build a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive food ecosystem.

Let us explore how engineering can support and enhance state initiatives, address structural challenges, and pave the way for food self-sufficiency.

1. Understanding the Challenges in Sabah’s Food System Sabah’s food sector faces a combination of environmental, technical, and infrastructural constraints:

Low Self-Sufficiency

Sabah currently produces about 23% of its rice needs and relies heavily on imported meat and vegetables.

Post-Harvest Losses

Estimates suggest up to 40% of perishable crops are lost due to inadequate storage and logistics.

Climate Variability

Floods, droughts and soil degradation increasingly affect yield stability.

Logistical Barriers

Mountainous terrain and remote rural settlements complicate farm-to-market connectivity.

Traditional Farming Practices

Many farmers still use rain-fed irrigation and manual tools, limiting productivity.

These realities, long acknowledged by policymakers and development agencies, underscore the need for multidisciplinary engineering contributions to complement agricultural policy.

2. Engineering-Driven Infrastructure Solutions

2.1 Road Access for Rural Farming Areas

Sabah’s hilly geography makes road construction both critical and complex. Engineering solutions such as geosynthetics, modular bridge systems, and slope stabilization techniques can improve year-round connectivity. These technologies are particularly useful in areas like Pitas, Tenom and Nabawan, where improved roads can reduce crop spoilage and improve market access.

2.2 Smart Irrigation and Drainage

Building upon current irrigation programs, engineers can design efficient water delivery systems — including drip irrigation, gravity-fed canals, and solar pump systems — suited to Sabah’s microclimates.

Surface drainage systems and flood-retention ponds can protect low-lying paddy fields, particularly in areas like Kota Belud. Integrated water resource management is key to resilience.

2.3 Cold Chains and Agro-Processing

Solar-powered cold storage units using phase change materials (PCMs), along with decentralized processing hubs, can help reduce post-harvest losses in perishable products. Mechanical and process engineers can work with local cooperatives to install modular rice mills, cassava dryers, and fish processing units — boosting rural incomes and value addition.

3. Smart and Sustainable Agricultural Engineering

3.1 Precision Farming Technologies

Data-driven agriculture is the future. Agricultural engineers and software developers can implement:

• IoT Soil Sensors to monitor moisture, temperature, and nutrients.

• Drone Surveillance with multispectral imaging to detect crop stress and pests.

• GIS Mapping for precision application of water and fertilizer.

Such approaches improve yields while reducing environmental impacts — initiatives already piloted in districts like Ranau and Kundasang.

3.2 Renewable Energy for Agricultural Applications

Sabah has significant renewable energy potential. Off-grid farms in interior regions can benefit from:

• Solar PV Systems for irrigation and refrigeration.

• Biogas Units converting animal waste into energy and organic fertilizers.

• Micro-Hydro Systems using highland streams for electricity generation.

Engineering expertise is needed to design hybrid systems with appropriate load management, battery storage, and safety measures.

3.3 Climate-Resilient Agro-Infrastructure

Engineering can help farms withstand extreme weather:

• Flood-Control Infrastructure (e.g., culverts, bunds, retention ponds) can safeguard farmland.

• Salt-Tolerant Greenhouses and elevated aquaponics systems protect against sea-level rise and waterlogging.

• Slope-Stabilized Planting Terraces help retain soil in erosion-prone zones.

Designing such systems requires close integration of hydrology, structural engineering, and local environmental data.

4. Enhancing Food Supply Chains through Technology

4.1 Blockchain and Traceability

Blockchain systems, combined with QR-coded packaging, can trace food origins, support Halal and organic certifications, and ensure quality. This benefits both farmers and consumers. Such platforms should be mobile-friendly and available in local languages to improve adoption.

4.2 AI-Based Smart Logistics

Flood-prone and rural zones can benefit from AI-driven logistics systems that use weather data, road conditions, and real-time transport tracking. During the 2021 floods, similar systems rerouted critical supplies successfully. Developing such tools in collaboration with disaster agencies and farmer cooperatives enhances preparedness and resilience.

5. Overcoming Implementation Barriers

Engineering-based transformation requires an enabling environment. Key challenges include:

• Financing and Investment: Engineering projects are capital-intensive. Public-private partnerships (PPPs), development funds, and ASEAN or UN-backed grants can help scale up pilots.

• Skills and Talent Development: Institutions like Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and local polytechnics can expand agri-tech and agri-engineering courses, blending agriculture with data science, energy and design.

• Community-Centric Design: Technology must fit local needs. Engineers should conduct participatory rural appraisals and engage local communities to co-design solutions.

6. Policy Recommendations to Accelerate Progress

To support food system modernization in alignment with Sabah’s development goals, policymakers may consider:

1. Integrating Engineering into RMK Plans: Prioritize agriculture-linked infrastructure and technology in Sabah’s development roadmaps.

2. Incentivizing Green and Smart Farming: Offer fiscal incentives (e.g., tax breaks, green loans) for businesses deploying renewable energy or agri-tech systems.

3. Forming Multisectoral Task Forces: Link engineers, farmers, NGOs, academics, and civil service units in coordinated project teams for infrastructure planning and monitoring.

Conclusion

Engineering is not just about infrastructure — it is a bridge between technology, sustainability, and livelihoods. In Sabah, engineering can reinforce the State Government’s goals by reducing food import dependency, enhancing rural resilience, and building a future-ready agricultural sector.

From slope-stabilized roads to solar-cooled storage, drone-assisted farming to blockchain supply tracking, engineering offers a practical, scalable path forward. With the right investments and inclusive partnerships, Sabah can transform its agricultural landscape — securing not only its food, but the well-being of its communities for generations to come.",en
43,The sprint to 2030: A march towards a sustainable Sabah,"EARTH Day, observed annually on April 22, serves as a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness with the planet and the vital need to conserve the Earth that sustains us. For us as Sabahan, this is a relevant message as the state government strives to protect our natural assets at the same time that she is providing sustainable economic development. The words of the Sabah governor at the opening of the recent DUN (state assembly) sitting – “leaving no Sabahan out” reflect the core of this message.

Sabah is a global leader in conserving her natural assets and sustainability. Sabah has put in place a policy to keep 30 per cent of its total land mass under fully protected area status by 2025. Currently, this stands at 27 per cent.

This policy pledge was made long before the United Nations’ Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted the Global Biodiversity Framework to ensure 30 per cent of our planet is under protection and conservation. Sabah has also aligned its policy with the National Forestry Policy to keep 50% of its total landmass under forest cover, as pledged by our then Prime Minister at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.

Maintaining this natural heritage is key to Sabah’s prosperity. Sabah owes much of its livelihoods and economic revenue to its natural resources. We are world-renowned for our biodiversity and wildlife. This wealth in flora and fauna has made tourism one of the biggest contributors to Sabah’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP) at 11.7%. The tourism sector has provided a lot of employment opportunities for the youths of Sabah, reducing youth migration, preventing ‘brain drain’ and allowing the local youth to be stewards of their own land. In addition, healthy forest acts as a natural carbon sink that absorbs greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Healthy ecosystems provide essential habitats for wildlife, act as a water catchment area that provides a source of drinking water, as well as absorbing access water to prevent flooding incidents.

The policy commitments protecting its natural heritage makes Sabah a global leader in biodiversity conservation and provision of ecosystem services. The services provided by forest include nature-based carbon capture to address the climate crisis of global warming. Recently, the government amended Forest Enactment 1968 to implement mandatory licensing for carbon credit trading. The legislation safeguards people’s interest and the sustainability of our forest resources.

How sustainable certifications benefit Sabah and its people

Sabah began gradually transitioning from timber to palm oil from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. While timber had been a dominant industry in the decades of the 1970s to the 1990s, palm oil had seen increasing demand and profitability by the end of the 20th century. In 2020, Sabah produced about 5 million tonnes of palm oil – about 6% of global output – making it the second-largest palm oil state in Malaysia, which is the world’s number-two producer. (Source: Malaysia’s Sabah aims to win big as world’s first green palm oil state). Today, Sabah is the largest crude palm oil (CPO) producer in the country, with the production of 4.5 million tonnes in 2023. As a major producer of a global commodity, Sabah is exposed to high financial, environmental and regulatory risk. Palm oil as a global commodity is subject to the vagaries of global price movement.

Industrial-scale palm oil plantations have been criticised as a major driver of deforestation, habitat loss and forest fire, leading to market campaigns and regulations against it. In Europe, a regulation called EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) is coming into force by requiring all deforestation-risk related products sold in the EU and exported from it, to be deforestation-free and in compliance with the laws of their production country.

To reduce these exposures and flip the negative perception, Sabah must position herself as a bastion of sustainable development. The goal must be to fulfil the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 12 on Sustainable Consumption and Production. In 2015, the Sabah state government did just that by making a commitment for all its palm oil to be 100% sustainably certified.",en
44,Sabah urged to assert carbon sovereignty as Federal Climate Bill looms,"abah, as Malaysia’s largest carbon sink, plays a critical role in the nation’s climate goals. 

With the federal Climate Change Bill (Rang Undang-Undang Perubahan Iklim, or RUUPIN) soon to be tabled in Parliament, the question of Sabah’s carbon sovereignty and rights has become urgent.

At a recent briefing and dialogue convened by the civil society coalition Carbon Sovereign Sabah (CSS), a group of elected state representatives were encouraged to act in the state’s best interest: “We are entrusting you to find ways to act for Sabah and Sabah’s sovereignty.”

Cynthia Ong of Land Empowerment Animals People (LEAP) shared that RUUPIN is being fast-tracked for tabling this June. In the meantime, Sabah’s State Legislative Assembly (DUN) has yet to deliberate on its own climate enactment, which would affirm state jurisdiction over carbon within its lands and waters, in accordance with the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) and the Federal Constitution. The rapid pace of climate legislation at the federal level requires immediate clarity and action from Sabah’s leadership. A proactive approach can safeguard the state’s valuable carbon resources and economic future
CSS acknowledged the federal government’s commitment to addressing climate change through RUUPIN, especially in light of the increasing climate risks in Southeast Asia and the global shift toward lower-emission trade requirements.

RUUPIN also supports Malaysia’s obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, the coalition emphasised that efforts risk fragmentation and undermining national climate commitments without genuine consultation and strategic harmonisation with Sabah.

Datuk Darrel Webber, Sabah’s Climate Change Advisor, was invited by CSS to provide a technical overview of the issues at stake. He explained that the state had undertaken its own assessment of emissions and sinks using the same methodology applied in the federal government’s UNFCCC submissions under the Paris Agreement. The analysis confirmed that the state functions as a net carbon sink due to Sabah’s long-standing commitments to forest conservation, avoidance of coal, and moderate industrial activity. Sabah’s forests significantly offset emissions of other regions and contribute the most significant share to Malaysia’s overall greenhouse gas absorption. In light of this, any future frameworks to tax emissions or reward sequestration must recognise Sabah’s contributions and stewardship of these resources.

Participants also reflected on historic concerns related to earlier federal legislation, such as the 1974 Petroleum Development Act (PDA), which had implications for Sabah’s resource management. Drawing from these past experiences, CSS encouraged the attending elected representatives — across political affiliations — to help ensure that transparent, inclusive, and forward-looking processes are in place to safeguard Sabah’s long-term rights and interests.

The event demonstrated the strength of multipartisan collaboration in addressing climate governance effectively and equitably.

Discussions at the session also acknowledged the significant progress already made in drafting Sabah’s climate enactment. Such legislation could provide the framework for responsible carbon stewardship while aligning with national climate objectives. As one of the few jurisdictions globally identified as a net sink, Sabah is well-positioned to play a leadership role in the emerging low-carbon economy.

Tungku assemblyman Assaffal Panglima Alian, who attended the session, later posted on social media that “Sabah’s rights and its sovereignty should be a priority to defend.”

Echoing this view, Senator Datuk Nelson Wences Angang emphasised the need for active state-federal collaboration to protect Sabah’s rights.

“The intention of the federal government to table the Climate Change Bill in the next parliamentary sitting is laudable, but it is vital for them to engage actively and sincerely with the state government of Sabah regarding the contents of the bill. This ensures that the state’s perspectives, needs and rights are considered and respected, leading to more effective policies. At the same time, the Sabah government must declare its stand on the bill, ensuring that none of Sabah’s rights and privileges are affected or taken away.”

Moyog assemblyman Datuk Darell Leiking also attended the gathering and emphasised the importance of vigilance. “The session revealed yet another potential timeline in which Sabah risks missing the forest for the trees. The State Government must ensure Sabah is not subjected to the unintended negative consequences of the upcoming National Climate Change Bill, especially where our sovereignty is concerned. We must act now to safeguard Sabah.”

Dr Robecca Jumin, WWF-Malaysia’s Head of Conservation for Sabah, noted the significance of Sabah’s legislative progress.

“A robust legislative framework is essential to ensure Sabah’s progress in conserving its natural resources continues hand in hand with sustainable economic development. Sabah’s forest carbon law, put in place through the recent amendment of the Forest Enactment 1968, reflects the state’s proactive commitment to responsible climate governance. With the right policies and alignment between state and federal efforts, we can foster mutual accountability, build climate resilience, and secure a thriving future for both people and nature.”

The session concluded with a shared understanding that federal legislation must respect Sabah’s constitutional position and complement the state’s efforts to develop sound, locally tailored climate policies. Through continued dialogue and collaboration, Sabah can advance climate action while upholding its rights and responsibilities within the federation.",en
45,Plastic pollution in Sabah worsening ,"Plastic pollution in Sabah is now becoming increasingly serious and is having a negative impact on the state’s image as a world-class tourism destination, said Deputy Chief Minister II Datuk Seri Joachim Gunsalam.

He said concerted efforts including strengthening and improving relevant laws and policies needed to be made to address the problem effectively.

He said the issue of plastic pollution is not just a problem abroad, and Sabah is no exception to facing the same problems and impacts.

“Plastic pollution threatens the environment and has a profound impact on every aspect of life, including the health of the ecosystem and the well-being of the community.

“Concerns over the increase in plastic pollution are not only a global issue but also have a serious impact on the state of Sabah,” he said in his speech at the opening of the “No plastic in Nature” symposium here Monday.

Joachim, who is also the Minister of Local Government and Housing, said many areas in Sabah, including Mount Kinabalu, which were once clean, are now polluted with waste.

“In the ocean, plastic floats and covers coral reefs, while our beaches and islands are filled with plastic,” he said.

He said that solving plastic pollution requires the cooperation of all parties, including the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector and other stakeholders.

He also praised the organisation of the symposium which is a platform for stakeholders to share information, views and initiatives related to plastic management.",en
46,Sabah takes stern stance after tourist collects protected starfish,"The Ministry of Tourism, Culture, and Environment Sabah (KePKAS) views seriously the recent viral issue on social media regarding the collection of starfish by a tourist believed to be a Chinese national, seen on a paddleboard (stand-up-paddle) in the waters of Kota Kinabalu.

Its minister, Datuk Seri Christina Liew, said as such actions are contrary to the principles of ecotourism, which emphasise the conservation of marine life, a core value upheld by the Sabah State Government in its commitment to sustainable tourism.

“Investigations conducted by the Board of Trustees of Sabah Parks (LPATTS) confirmed that the incident took place in the waters of Tanjung Aru, outside the boundaries of Tunku Abdul Rahman Park, and involved a tour company.

“A total of 30 starfish were collected, identified as the Horned Sea Star or Chocolate Chip Sea Star, known locally as tapak sulaiman bertanduk (Protoreaster nodosus).

“These starfish play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the marine ecosystem, and their removal can potentially disrupt this delicate balance,” Liew said in a statement on Sunday.

In light of this, the minister urged all tour operators to exercise greater responsibility in ensuring that their tourists and staff adhere strictly to the established guidelines and regulations, particularly those concerning the protection of marine life.

“Awareness and compliance with these regulations are vital to ensure the sustainability of the marine ecosystem for the well-being of future generations,” she said.

Stressing that the Sabah State Government, through KePKAS, remains committed to environmental conservation efforts, Liew warned that the authorities will not hesitate to take stern action against any party found violating regulations related to wildlife and natural ecosystems in the State.

“We will be working with the relevant agencies regarding this issue,” she added.",en
47,New bill strengthens protection of Sabah forests,"The Sabah State Legislative Assembly has passed the Forest Enactment (Amendment) Bill 2025 aimed at reinforcing forest protection efforts while positioning the state to participate meaningfully in the global carbon market.

Assistant Minister to the Chief Minister, Datuk Abidin Madingkir, who tabled the Bill, said the amendments come at a crucial time as Sabah ramps up efforts to address climate change, promote sustainable forest management and ensure forest-related revenues benefit the state directly. “Now is the most appropriate time for us to enact specific legislation to regulate forest carbon credit trading activities to safeguard the state’s interests and ensure the sustainability of our forest resources,” he said.

Sabah, he said, continues to maintain approximately 63 percent of its land area under forest cover, in line with the national commitment to preserve at least 50 percent of the country’s land mass under forest cover.

Additionally, under the Sabah Forest Policy 2018, the Sabah State Government remains committed to its policy of gazetting no less than 30 percent of the state’s total land area as Totally Protected Areas (TPAs), to ensure sufficient coverage for environmental protection and enhancement of ecosystem services.

This effort aligns with Sabah’s commitment to address climate change issues, realise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and contribute to Malaysia’s national commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP-26) and the UN Global Biodiversity Framework.

Sabah is not exempt from facing international concerns regarding climate change and forest degradation, as raised in various global conventions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Considering this, and in response to the State Government’s concern for enhancing forest protection and addressing global environmental challenges, the Forest Enactment (Amendment) Bill 2025 has been drafted to introduce specific provisions, including regulating forest-based carbon activities, granting authority to the Chief Conservator of Forests to close parts of forest reserves, empowering the imposition of fees and the issuance of permits; and matters related thereto.

According to Abidin, Article 74(2) of the Federal Constitution grants the State Government the authority to enact laws relating to forests and at the national level, the Federal Government is expected to introduce a Climate Change Act this year.

“Therefore, to ensure that the trade of forest carbon credits falls under the jurisdiction of the State Government, this Bill must be passed without delay. Now is the most appropriate time for us to enact specific legislation to regulate forest carbon credit trading activities to safeguard the state’s interests and the sustainability of forest resources,” he said.

Abidin told the State Assembly that carbon stored in trees has already been defined as forest produce through the amendment of Section 2 of the Forest Enactment 1968 in 2013. As such, any benefits derived from forest carbon credit trading should rightfully benefit Sabah.

“There is a need to establish specific mechanisms to regulate forest carbon activities, including international trading, to ensure that Sabah’s rights remain protected. Through this amendment, forest carbon activities within forest reserves, state land, and alienated land will be licensed according to agreed terms and conditions that safeguard the state’s interests.

“With this legislation in place, any provisions, funds and revenues obtained from this initiative will be channelled directly to the state. This is crucial in supporting the Sabah Government’s efforts to strike a balance between conservation, revenue generation, and ensuring sustainable development for the state in the future,” he stressed.

The Bill also introduces stiffer penalties for forest-related offences under the Forest Enactment 1968.

Those found guilty of causing forest fires could face up to 10 years in prison or fines of up to RM500,000.

For illegal logging or unauthorised felling of trees in forest reserves or on state land, the maximum fine has been raised to RM5 million, with jail terms ranging from two to 20 years.

“These amendments are in line with the National Forestry Act (Amendment) 2022 and will enhance enforcement while promoting responsible forest stewardship,” said Abidin.

The new sections introduced under the Bill, 12A through 12E, grant the Chief Conservator of Forests the power to declare temporary closures of forest reserves to facilitate better management and protection.

A new Section 24E empowers the Chief Conservator, or any authorised officer, to issue permits for activities otherwise prohibited under Section 20(1) of the Enactment — except for those specified under subparagraph 20(1)(a)(ii).

“These provisions will ease the issuance of permits for essential forest-related activities, such as building infrastructure in accordance with forest management needs,” he explained.

Additionally, an amendment to Section 24C is proposed to require holders of any licence or forest reserve management agreement licence to pay an annual forest rental fee to the Sabah Government.

48,Address gaps in laws to protect environment,"Addressing the gaps in legislation that allow for unsustainable practices is necessary, said Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Abdul Rahman Sebli.

He said that advocating for policies that ensure environmental conservation is also a must.

“It is vital for us to recognise the importance of preserving this beautiful landscape for generations to come,” Abdul Rahman said when launching the Borneo Rainforest Law Conference at the Sabah International Convention Centre (SICC) here on Monday.

He suggested more stringent laws on environmental threats, citing Sabah, an ecological haven that continued to face environmental threats.

“Even in this ecological haven (Sabah), we are witnessing the impacts of environmental challenges that require our focused legal attention,” he said.

Earlier in his speech, Abdul Rahman commended on Sabah’s lush rainforests which is endowed with “an incredible diversity of plant and animal species, some of which are endemic to this region.”

“The towering dipterocarp trees, vibrant orchids – known as the “Gold of Kinabalu”, and unique pitcher plants create an intricate tapestry that is unparalleled. The majestic Mount Kinabalu, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a testament to Sabah’s natural beauty, harbouring a multitude of endemic species in its diverse ecosystems,” he said.

He invited those present to delve into the intricate legal landscape concerning environmental issues in Malaysia and the Commonwealth countries, as well as on Sabah and her unique geographical features, including the famed Salt Trail within the depths of the Crocker Range.

“It has been said that Sabah’s history can be traced along the Salt Trail of the Crocker Range. This century-old 34km passage between Inobong and Kampung Tikolod links some of the most traditional Dusunic hamlets between Penampang and the interior Tambunan, cutting across the primeval mountain range and highland tropical rainforests of Sabah. The trail was once used as a route by villagers to easily access town markets with their fresh produce and return with salt and other goods,” he said.

He added that until today, the salt trail remains the accessible route to remote villages, especially in the upper Papar river and Tambunan area.

“Natural wonders like the Crocker Range contribute significantly to the rich biodiversity and cultural heritage of Sabah.

“Nestled on the island of Borneo, Sabah boasts a breath-taking array of flora and fauna, making it a global biodiversity hotspot,” he said.

Abdul Rahman added that he had the opportunity to embark on the Salt Trail adventure last year and described it as an unforgettable experience.

“I gained a deep appreciation for the lush forest and the rich culture of the indigenous people in Sabah. Despite its challenges, the adventure would not disappoint those seeking a unique Borneo experience in its famous rainforest environment,” he said.

Unfortunately, the impacts of environmental challenges that require focused legal attention were also witnessed in this ecological haven, he said.

Citing the report on the ‘Sabah Biodiversity Conservation Project: Identification of Potential Protected Areas – Crocker Range Foothill’, the Tourism, Culture and Environment Ministry has identified various threats to biodiversity conservation in the Crocker Range.

The major threats to conservation efforts include commercial logging in State and alienated land outside the Crocker Range Park, illegal logging within the Crocker Range Park, and fires, he said.

At the same time, poaching, habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict pose significant threats to iconic species such as the Bornean orangutan, pygmy elephant and the Sumatran rhinoceros, he said.

“To safeguard their future, stringent legal measures are imperative. Legal frameworks must be enhanced to deter illegal wildlife trade and ensure the preservation of Sabah’s charismatic fauna for future generations,” he stressed.

Meanwhile, Sabah’s marine biodiversity, characterised by vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life, faces threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change, he said.

“Legal practitioners and marine experts are encouraged to advocate for robust legislation to safeguard marine ecosystems, promoting sustainable fishing practices and marine conservation efforts,” he urged.

Abdul Rahman stressed that environmental protection is paramount and must not be neglected in any context.

In his speech, he also said that climate change presents a global crisis that demands a unified response, and Malaysia is not exempt from its impacts.

He stressed that it is imperative for the legal framework to adapt and evolve to confront the challenges posed by climate change.

“This entails promoting renewable energy sources, incentivizing energy efficiency measures, and integrating climate resilience into urban planning and development regulations,” he said.

And within Commonwealth countries, historical environmental injustices have disproportionately impacted vulnerable communities, he said.

“In addressing the impact of environmental justice on constitutional law within the Commonwealth, we have to find common ground in the pursuit of equitable and inclusive legal frameworks,” he said.

He urged Commonwealth nations to unite in their commitment to protect the environment.

“The ancient principles of the Public Trust Doctrine (PTD), deeply ingrained in the constitutional fabric of many Commonwealth countries, underscore the obligation to safeguard natural resources for the benefit of all citizens. The PTD has been recognized by English Courts since at least 1299, establishing that the state has a fiduciary duty to safeguard vital natural resources and hold them in trust for the benefit of both current and future generations. It enshrines the right for people to fish, gather food, and navigate our shared tidal waters,” he reminded.

He also said that collaboration between the legal community, government bodies, and non-governmental organizations is paramount in addressing these issues.

“We must work together to streamline and strengthen existing environmental laws, ensuring that they are comprehensive, up-to-date, and effectively enforced. This collaboration should extend to educating the public about environmental rights and fostering a sense of responsibility towards our planet,” he said.

Abdul Rahman added that we have a duty to champion the cause of environmental conservation both in Malaysia and within the Commonwealth countries.

“Our legal system must serve as a bulwark (defence) against environmental degradation, providing a solid foundation for sustainable development. Let us come together, raise our voices, and actively contribute to a legal landscape that safeguards our environment for future generations. The time to act is now, and our commitment to this cause will shape the environmental legacy within the Commonwealth countries for years to come.”

Present were Deputy Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea, Ambeng Kandakasi; Justice Brian J Preston, Chief Judge of the Land and Environmental Court in New South Wales; Fleur Kingham, president of the Land Court of Queensland; Lord Robert Carnwath of Notting Hill CVO, Justice of the Supreme Court of United Kingdom (retired); and Tan Sri Datuk Seri Panglima David Wong Dak Wah, former Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak.

49,Blu Hope to reverse environmental damage in Sabah,"What happens to Sabah’s biodiversity will determine the fate of the rest of the planet in the future.

This state, located on the East coast of Borneo, is arguably one of the most precious pieces of real estate, biodiversity-wise left on the planet. Such a status means that any inspired action taken to help reverse its slow but sure death would make a huge difference anywhere else across the world.

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt lives and economies, humans are now forced to rethink their relationship with biodiversity, find innovative solutions and make a pledge to heal our critically-ill planet.

The Sabah Plastic Neutral platform, that is led and promoted by Blu Hope, embraces this aspiration and sets up the start of a ten-year journey toward pushing for the planet’s steady recovery.

While both Sabah and Timor-Leste pledged to move forward towards plastic neutrality, it is not just about addressing the problem with plastic pollution. A lot of what is happening on the ground will be the key factors that drive change, particularly in terms of people’s mindset and habits.

Blu Hope is ever determined to connect all the dots – from people in positions of power who make decisions down to ordinary individuals on the ground working toward making change happen and bring real, tangible, shared value from plastic waste to all Sabahans and Timorese.

Since Sabah Plastic Neutral’s launching in March this year, the movement has seen two important events happening. The first, when the state government through the Kota Kinabalu City Hall agreed to collaborate to reduce plastic waste in and around the city.

With the government on board, Blu Hope is now in the position of strength and what will follow is a major clean-up campaign of plastic waste with the help, among others, from island communities of Pulau Gaya – just outside capital, Kota Kinabalu. There is no date fixed yet for the project as the pandemic has forced everyone under strict lockdown at the moment.

The second event is the signing of partnership with a Norwegian company, VOW bringing French technology from ETIA into Sabah that would turn waste to energy. When this happens, it will mark yet another important milestone as plastic waste will no longer be disposed in the landfill but will now be converted into green energy.

The biggest potential ‘game changer’ however is Blu Hope’s proposed digital recycling ‘Equaliser’ app, called ReWild – offering the opportunity for everyone to profit from recycling their own waste the world over.

By working with key FMGC companies, ReWild users will be able to scan the bar code of each product using their smart phone linking to each plastic product’s market value correlating to its volume and polymer type.

After the waste has been collected or deposited at recycling centres, the app user will be rewarded financially via various payment mechanisms.

What’s more, users will also have an option to donate rewards to NGO’s focussed on communities and protecting Sabah’s unique biodiversity via Sabah Plastic Neutral too.

“With plastic waste soon to have a monetary value – this will mean ‘extra food on the table’ – in turn, incentivising the biggest and quickest clean up of Sabah’s local environment ever!” says Blu Hope founder, Simon Christopher.

“Essentially this is about ‘value’. Just as Covid is now forcing us to re-asses Nature’s intrinsic value to our very own survival, by combining value from people’s waste with significantly increased recycling efforts locally will be a great way to drive change as quickly as possible. Even better – those comfortable enough to feed their families each and every day in other parts of the world will also have the option to directly benefit Sabahan communities on the ground an ongoing basis too. This is the ‘Equaliser’ effect and our goal with ReWild is to help catalyse a global circular economy starting with Sabah and Timor-Leste,” says Simon.

Blu Hope is not only fighting plastic pollution. It connects and empowers other initiatives serving the greater good for the environment and biodiversity.

Partnering up with specialist French water-purifier manufacturer Fonto de Vivo and working closely with Sabah Education department, their upcoming Water Is Life! program promises to deliver reliable, safe/clean drinking water to all schools across Sabah.

As well as removing people’s reliance on plastic bottles, utilising super-engaging education and awareness programmes with Sir David Attenborough and fun ‘Plastic Detectives’ activities produced by Plastic Oceans UK, with well-known actress and environmentalist Maya Karin narrating in Malay, the aim is to trigger behaviour change in the home starting with school children.

Blu Hope are also working closely with Stop Fish Bombing Malaysia to help solve the very serious issue of fish bombing by providing alternative livelihood programmes from plastic collection, seaweed farming, etc too.

These initiatives are just the beginning. What Blu Hope foresees is that all the local initiatives in Sabah that are working on conservation and biodiversity protection, be it at land or sea, would connect with one another forming a single mission.

The big picture that is expected to steadily grow over the first few years of this decade is that Blu Hope’s success in Sabah and Timor-Leste will steadily expand out to other locations in the Coral Triangle, the world’s most important marine biodiversity region.

With these local initiatives combined, Blu Hope will be launching their Coral Triangle Plastic Neutral platform today, officially Coral Triangle Day – a move that would hopefully lead to the rest of the world to buy in and adopt what has been started in Sabah in their own back yard.

And Sabah and Timor- Leste both aiming to become plastic neutral is also hoped to take centre stage at Expo Dubai 2021, boasted to be the world’s biggest fair bringing people of different nationalities to share ideas and build relationships as well as celebrating a world of interdependence.

For Blu Hope, this will be the stage to send a strong message about how Sabah and Timor-Leste, as the two last bastions of biodiversity on the planet, have both taken all the right initiatives, starting with plastic, to rebuild a world where all species are indeed interdependent on one another.

Another key message leading to that global event and throughout the rest of UNESCO Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) has been that the health of the planet’s biodiversity rests in the hands of the younger generation.

Blu Hope’s dot-connecting effort starting in Sabah is hoped to be passed down to the world’s younger generation for in them, lies the hope for change.

“Blu Hope’s inspiration in-part comes from legendary naturalists Sir David Attenborough and ‘Her-Royal-Deepness’ Dr Sylvia Earle’s words of wisdom and through Blu Hope Youth, it’s mission critical we ‘pass the baton down’ to younger generations.

“Equally, with Blu Hope LIFE we’ll embrace the needs of Sabah’s unregistered and undocumented folks like the Bajau Laut sea gypsies and these are the extremely important, core, deep and meaningful themes behind Sabah and Timor-Leste Plastic Neutral at the beginning of UNESCO Ocean Decade,” said Blu Hope co-founder/Community Director Monica Chin.",en
50,Surviving climate change in Borneo,"ONE thing that grabbed my attention during our recent trip to National Science Centre in early January was a map (see figure) that illustrated the expected sea level rise by 2100 projected by National Hydraulic Research Institute (Nahrim).

It shows that for Malaysia, the east coast of Sabah – from Kudat to Tawau – will be the area that experiences the highest sea level rise, ranging between 0.4 to 1.1 metres with an average of about 0.5 metres. Especially, the south-eastern area bordering North Kalimantan has some of the darkest red dots.

Three weeks later, I was in Tawau. The city is surrounded by the Sulu Sea to the east and the Celebes Sea to the south. Established in the 1890s by the British, it was destroyed during World War 2 but was later rebuilt. According to the Census 2020 report, the urban area is now home to nearly 290,000 inhabitants. However, outside the city, the population is relatively small with only about 84,000 people scattered throughout the district.

Most areas in the district are planted with oil palm, except the city and the Tawau Hills Park. As a border district, Tawau serves as the gateway to Kalimantan, with international ferry services connecting it to Nunukan of North Kalimantan.

The downtown area facing Cowie Bay may be particularly vulnerable to the rise in sea level. Physical infrastructure such as buildings, ports, roads, sewage discharge facilities, power lines, and others could suffer damage from seawater intrusion or even be inundated.

The coastal region is also home to many Tawau residents, with numerous ‘water villages’ consisting of houses built on seawater lining up from east to west. These residents are among the most affected if the water level continues to increase. By the end of the century, large swaths of low-lying land could also be engulfed by the sea.

The effects of sea-level rise resulting from climate change are not limited to artificial borders and are expected to impact the Indonesian counterparts as well. From Tawau to Nunukan, large tracts of mangrove forests can be found along the coast. Coastal erosion due to the changes in currents and waves will bring devastating impacts on coastal ecosystems. In addition to physical alterations, salt contamination of freshwater aquifers by seawater intrusions may also greatly damage flora and fauna, destroying habitats for both lives on land and below water. Changes in soil and water properties can be harmful to agriculture, causing cropland degradation and reducing productivity.

However, the threat of climate change to Borneo can be insidious. Unlike its northern neighbour, i.e., the Philippines, Borneo is fortunate to stay outside the general range of cyclones. However, the increasing frequency and severity of flood events across the island have reminded people about the potential impacts of climate change and sea level rise. There were numerous reports of flash floods across Borneo in 2022, with unusually heavy rainfalls cited as a main cause.

To make things worse, land cover changes considerably exacerbate the flood risks. By mapping flood events across Kalimantan, a group of researchers, J. A. Wells and the team in their paper published in 2016 found that flood frequency was associated with land use activities like logging and mining. In contrast, the villages in more forested watersheds were found to have a lesser flood risk.

Things can also go the other way – droughts and fires. Droughts in Borneo have become more intense in the past decades. The uncontrolled fire events were made worse, becoming much larger and longer due to El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The most recent massive fire event occurred in 2015, mainly in Central Kalimantan, causing enormous economic loss up to billions of US dollars.

In the event of a worst-case scenario, the inhabitants of the central area of Borneo may need to brace themselves for a temperature increase of approximately 4 degrees Celsius by the conclusion of the 21st century. This elevated temperature could have severe consequences for public health, including heat waves that may endanger vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. Additionally, the risk of fire could be exacerbated by the rise in temperature.

Several solutions have been proposed to combat climate change. Some coastal cities have opted for adaptation measures, such as constructing seawalls, re-planning roads, and planting mangroves, in order to enhance their resilience to environmental changes.

Meanwhile, countries have implemented a variety of energy and industrial policies to mitigate climate change and reduce emissions. However, many of these approaches face challenges due to their high costs and people’s reluctance to alter their lifestyles and behaviors.

One potential area where Borneo can make a significant contribution is by reducing and preventing greenhouse gas emissions through its abundant natural capital.

Borneo plays a major role in global emission dynamics due to its substantial terrestrial carbon stocks. Proper and sustainable management of land use activities, particularly agricultural expansion and mining, will be an immediate priority for Borneo in tackling climate change.

The urgency of the climate crisis presents an opportunity to bring together various stakeholders to achieve a sustainable transformation of Borneo’s economy, which is currently heavily reliant on primary resource extraction. However, attaining this objective requires clear and concise vision from decision-makers.

“We will certainly find solutions to these problems.” I was surprised by my 7-year-old’s optimism.

“How?” My big ask.

“Don’t know, but we will when we run the world.”

While the early 21st century was marked by great innovation and exciting developments, it was also a time of global chaos and widespread anxiety. As I stared out of my hotel room window, the disturbing scenes from Netflix shows – destruction, pollution, and conflict – flashed through my mind.

I hope that the world we leave behind for the next generation is not too bleak.
