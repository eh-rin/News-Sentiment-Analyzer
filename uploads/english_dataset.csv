Blue economy and development in Sabah and its challenges,"As we move towards a more sustainable economic model, the Blue Economy has emerged as a key pillar for economic diversification and environmentalconservation. Sabah has vast coastline, rich marine biodiversity, and strategic location in the South China Sea, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this economic shift. The Blue Economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources to promote economic growth, enhance livelihoods, and ensure marine ecosystem health. It encompasses various sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, marine tourism, maritime transport, renewable energy, and marine biotechnology. Given Sabah’s abundant marine resources and coastal industries, the Blue Economy offers a strategic opportunity for long-term economic prosperity. However, significant challenges and issues hinder the development of Sabah’s Blue Economy, including climate change, pollution, overfishing, weak infrastructure, and regulatory gaps. Addressing these obstacles requires collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, research institutions, and local communities. One of the most critical stakeholders in advancing the Blue Economy is the engineering sector. Engineers play a vital role in infrastructure development, technology innovation, and environmental management, ensuring that ocean-based industries grow sustainably. ",en,positive

Saving our forests for the future,"The Covid-19 crisis is believed to have opened the door for radical changes that are essential to safeguard our forests and help prevent the next pandemic. Tropical forest regions that experience land-use change are more prone to forest loss and if this is allowed to continue, prevention of future pandemics may not be a realistic option. Our approach to forests, therefore, has to change for the better, and as governments create policies to address the economic and social impacts of the global pandemic, there is an equally pressing need to confront issues of over-consumption and put greater value on health and nature. This is humanity’s best interests. As part of its efforts to bring to light the seriousness of forest loss, WWF recently launched the ‘Deforestation fronts: Drivers and responses in a changing world’ report which provides an in-depth analysis of deforestation hotspots. Referred to as deforestation fronts in the report, these hotspots are remaining parts of large forests of global importance that are under threat. The report reveals that an area roughly twice the size of the UK was lost to deforestation globally in just over a decade. While Borneo is among the 24 countries identified as a deforestation hotspot in the report, it is crucial to know that the numbers attributed to Borneo in the report represent the summation of forest loss in both tropical Indonesia Borneo and tropical Malaysia Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak).",en,
