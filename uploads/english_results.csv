Blue economy and development in Sabah and its challenges,"As we move towards a more sustainable economic model, the Blue Economy has emerged as a key pillar for economic diversification and environmentalconservation. Sabah has vast coastline, rich marine biodiversity, and strategic location in the South China Sea, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this economic shift. The Blue Economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources to promote economic growth, enhance livelihoods, and ensure marine ecosystem health. It encompasses various sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, marine tourism, maritime transport, renewable energy, and marine biotechnology. Given Sabah’s abundant marine resources and coastal industries, the Blue Economy offers a strategic opportunity for long-term economic prosperity. However, significant challenges and issues hinder the development of Sabah’s Blue Economy, including climate change, pollution, overfishing, weak infrastructure, and regulatory gaps. Addressing these obstacles requires collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, research institutions, and local communities. One of the most critical stakeholders in advancing the Blue Economy is the engineering sector. Engineers play a vital role in infrastructure development, technology innovation, and environmental management, ensuring that ocean-based industries grow sustainably.

Saving our forests for the future,"The Covid-19 crisis is believed to have opened the door for radical changes that are essential to safeguard our forests and help prevent the next pandemic. Tropical forest regions that experience land-use change are more prone to forest loss and if this is allowed to continue, prevention of future pandemics may not be a realistic option. Our approach to forests, therefore, has to change for the better, and as governments create policies to address the economic and social impacts of the global pandemic, there is an equally pressing need to confront issues of over-consumption and put greater value on health and nature. This is humanity’s best interests. As part of its efforts to bring to light the seriousness of forest loss, WWF recently launched the ‘Deforestation fronts: Drivers and responses in a changing world’ report which provides an in-depth analysis of deforestation hotspots. Referred to as deforestation fronts in the report, these hotspots are remaining parts of large forests of global importance that are under threat. The report reveals that an area roughly twice the size of the UK was lost to deforestation globally in just over a decade. While Borneo is among the 24 countries identified as a deforestation hotspot in the report, it is crucial to know that the numbers attributed to Borneo in the report represent the summation of forest loss in both tropical Indonesia Borneo and tropical Malaysia Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak).",en,saving our forests for the future,en,the covid19 crisis is believed to have opened the door for radical changes that are essential to safeguard our forests and help prevent the next pandemic tropical forest regions that experience landuse change are more prone to forest loss and if this is allowed to continue prevention of future pandemics may not be a realistic option our approach to forests therefore has to change for the better and as governments create policies to address the economic and social impacts of the global pandemic there is an equally pressing need to confront issues of overconsumption and put greater value on health and nature this is humanitys best interests as part of its efforts to bring to light the seriousness of forest loss wwf recently launched the deforestation fronts drivers and responses in a changing world report which provides an indepth analysis of deforestation hotspots referred to as deforestation fronts in the report these hotspots are remaining parts of large forests of global importance that are under threat the report reveals that an area roughly twice the size of the uk was lost to deforestation globally in just over a decade while borneo is among the 24 countries identified as a deforestation hotspot in the report it is crucial to know that the numbers attributed to borneo in the report represent the summation of forest loss in both tropical indonesia borneo and tropical malaysia borneo sabah and sarawak,en,en,nl,the covid19 crisis is believed to have opened the door for radical changes that are essential to safeguard our forests and help prevent the next pandemic tropical forest regions that experience landuse change are more prone to forest loss and if this is allowed to continue prevention of future pandemics may not be a realistic option our approach to forests therefore has to change for the better and as governments create policies to address the economic and social impacts of the global pandemic there is an equally pressing need to confront issues of overconsumption and put greater value on health and nature this is humanitys best interests as part of its efforts to bring to light the seriousness of forest loss wwf recently launched the deforestation fronts drivers and responses in a changing world report which provides an indepth analysis of deforestation hotspots referred to as deforestation fronts in the report these hotspots are remaining parts of large forests of global importance that are under threat the report reveals that an area roughly twice the size of the uk was lost to deforestation globally in just over a decade while borneo is among the 24 countries identified as a deforestation hotspot in the report it is crucial to know that the numbers attributed to borneo in the report represent the summation of forest loss in both tropical indonesia borneo and tropical malaysia borneo sabah and sarawak,en,Positive
"Sabah launches Forest Seed Garden project to boost sustainable timber, biodiversity","The Sabah Forestry Department (SFD) and Sawit Kinabalu Group are collaborating to establish the Forest Seed Garden (FSG) at Sungai Pin Conservation Area (SPnCA) in Kinabatangan. This partnership aims to develop an agroforestry model incorporating timber plantation trees, with a focus on sustainable forestry practices and biodiversity conservation. The Letter of Intent for this project was handed over at the Forestry headquarters in Sandakan today. The initial phase of the project will involve research to evaluate cost efficiency and optimal plantation practices, including fertiliser treatments and mulching, as well as methods for enhancing timber growth. The study will provide valuable insights into the viability of agroforestry systems for timber production in Sabah. Under SFD, research work will be undertaken by the Forest Plantation Programme of the Forest Research Centre while for Sawit Kinabalu, it will be carried out by the Conservation and Biodiversity Unit. “This is an exciting endeavour and an important project, as the two parties start to work towards the goal of establishing a sustainable model that can be replicated.

"Sabah Forestry Department proactive, committed in mangrove management","Mangrove forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. This remarkable ecosystem can store carbon belowground as a soil carbon up to four times more efficient than other forest types.

Role of engineers in mitigating climate change and global warming in Sabah,"The realities of climate change and global warming are no longer abstract concepts confined to scientific journals or global conferences nowadays. These phenomena have direct and tangible effects on regions worldwide, including Sabah, Malaysia. Known for its rich biodiversity, pristine rainforests, and vibrant coastal ecosystems, Sabah is increasingly under threat from the adverse impacts of climate change. The intensified frequent flooding, coastal erosion, and shifts in weather patterns are just some of the challenges that have emerged over the past decades. In view of these problems, engineers have an irreplaceable role in mitigating these challenges and ensuring that Sabah not only adapts to the changing climate but also contributes to the global effort to curb its progression. Engineering is a discipline rooted in problem-solving, and the solutions it can offer to climate-related issues are manifold.
