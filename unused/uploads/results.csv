Blue economy and development in Sabah and its challenges,"As we move towards a more sustainable economic model, the Blue Economy has emerged as a key pillar for economic diversification and environmentalconservation. Sabah has vast coastline, rich marine biodiversity, and strategic location in the South China Sea, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this economic shift. The Blue Economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources to promote economic growth, enhance livelihoods, and ensure marine ecosystem health. It encompasses various sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, marine tourism, maritime transport, renewable energy, and marine biotechnology. Given Sabah’s abundant marine resources and coastal industries, the Blue Economy offers a strategic opportunity for long-term economic prosperity. However, significant challenges and issues hinder the development of Sabah’s Blue Economy, including climate change, pollution, overfishing, weak infrastructure, and regulatory gaps. Addressing these obstacles requires collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, research institutions, and local communities. One of the most critical stakeholders in advancing the Blue Economy is the engineering sector. Engineers play a vital role in infrastructure development, technology innovation, and environmental management, ensuring that ocean-based industries grow sustainably. ",Positive,en

Saving our forests for the future,"The Covid-19 crisis is believed to have opened the door for radical changes that are essential to safeguard our forests and help prevent the next pandemic. Tropical forest regions that experience land-use change are more prone to forest loss and if this is allowed to continue, prevention of future pandemics may not be a realistic option. Our approach to forests, therefore, has to change for the better, and as governments create policies to address the economic and social impacts of the global pandemic, there is an equally pressing need to confront issues of over-consumption and put greater value on health and nature. This is humanity’s best interests. As part of its efforts to bring to light the seriousness of forest loss, WWF recently launched the ‘Deforestation fronts: Drivers and responses in a changing world’ report which provides an in-depth analysis of deforestation hotspots. Referred to as deforestation fronts in the report, these hotspots are remaining parts of large forests of global importance that are under threat. The report reveals that an area roughly twice the size of the UK was lost to deforestation globally in just over a decade. While Borneo is among the 24 countries identified as a deforestation hotspot in the report, it is crucial to know that the numbers attributed to Borneo in the report represent the summation of forest loss in both tropical Indonesia Borneo and tropical Malaysia Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak).",Positive,en
"Sabah launches Forest Seed Garden project to boost sustainable timber, biodiversity","The Sabah Forestry Department (SFD) and Sawit Kinabalu Group are collaborating to establish the Forest Seed Garden (FSG) at Sungai Pin Conservation Area (SPnCA) in Kinabatangan. This partnership aims to develop an agroforestry model incorporating timber plantation trees, with a focus on sustainable forestry practices and biodiversity conservation. The Letter of Intent for this project was handed over at the Forestry headquarters in Sandakan today. The initial phase of the project will involve research to evaluate cost efficiency and optimal plantation practices, including fertiliser treatments and mulching, as well as methods for enhancing timber growth. The study will provide valuable insights into the viability of agroforestry systems for timber production in Sabah. Under SFD, research work will be undertaken by the Forest Plantation Programme of the Forest Research Centre while for Sawit Kinabalu, it will be carried out by the Conservation and Biodiversity Unit. “This is an exciting endeavour and an important project, as the two parties start to work towards the goal of establishing a sustainable model that can be replicated. Work on the project is already underway, with a total of six plots established as part of the initial phase,” said a statement.",Positive,en
Sabah establishes council to address climate change issues,"The State Government has established the Sabah Climate Action Council (SCAC) to set direction and coordinate climate change mitigation and adaptation projects at the state level, said Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor. According to the Chief Minister, Sabah has amended the Sabah Land Ordinance Chapter 68 to include legal provisions related to carbon storage, which came into effect on June 19, 2023. “In addition, Sabah has also just completed the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory study and vulnerability assessment for the development of the Sabah Climate Change Policy towards a low-carbon development,” he said.",Negative,en
CM: Sabah ready to work with stakeholders in combating climate change,"The Sabah State Government will collaborate with all stakeholders to combat climate change and its challenges, said Chief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Haji Hajiji Haji Noor. He said the State Government is taking steps in this direction, including agroforestry programmes, organic farming incentives, and community-based conservation projects aimed at building resilience among local populations. “However, these efforts require sustained support not only from within Malaysia but also from international partners committed to fostering sustainable development,” he said at the Kinabalu Convention 2025: Food Security, Climate Change and Investment at the Magellan Sutera Resort here on Monday. His speech was delivered by Deputy Chief Minister/Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Jeffrey Kitingan.

We invite businesses, investors and all like-minded organisations to explore green investments to address these issues,” he said.",Positive,en
Sabah Forestry Department strives to excel in Sustainable Forest Management,"The Sabah Forestry Department strives to excel in Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), and innovation can indeed play a crucial role in creating a better way of life for both humans and forests. Chief Conservator of Forests, Datuk Frederick Kugan, said the forests are an important natural asset to the state, not only for their significant contribution to socioeconomic development but also for their essential role in the maintenance of the quality of the environment, biodiversity, and forest recreation. Hence, sustainable use of natural resources from the forests and biodiversity conservation with innovative approaches are significant in ensuring a better tomorrow for our future generation. Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) is among the earlier innovative features in SFM, he said in a statement to mark the International Day of Forests (IDF), which falls on March 21. According to Kugan, today’s innovative technologies, such as drones, satellite imaging and mapping can be used to monitor forests, identify areas for restoration, combat deforestation and illegal logging. Among some of the up-to-date applications in forestry operation include IForSabah and GeoForest while in forestry research, we have the Conservation Area Information and Monitoring System (CAIMS) and the Sabah Ecosystem Hub.",Positive,en
"Sabah Forestry Department proactive, committed in mangrove management","Mangrove forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. This remarkable ecosystem can store carbon belowground as a soil carbon up to four times more efficient than other forest types. The mangrove ecosystem supports a diverse range of organisms by providing breeding grounds, habitats and nurseries for various marine species. Realising the importance of mangroves, the Chief Conservator of Forests, Datuk Frederick Kugan, highlighted that the Sabah Forestry Department has been proactive and committed in mangrove management. Sabah’s Mangrove Action Plan which was developed and launched last year serves as a guide to efficiently manage the mangrove forests in Sabah, encompassing conservation, protection and restoration of mangroves, in line with the ‘Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ)’ and Sabah Forest Policy 2018. Successful mangrove rehabilitation in degraded areas depended on suitable planting methods and proper site selection. It is important to understand the autecology and natural expansion of mangrove forests, as it is not a one-time effort, but rather requires an ongoing commitment and continuous work for the betterment of mangrove ecosystems.",Positive,en
