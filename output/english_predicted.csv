Nearly 300km Sabah’s coast under assault,according to department of irrigation and drainage did some 2955km of sabahs 1743km coastline is in danger of being lost to the sea among these 128km have been classified as critical category 1 35km as significant category 2 and 2792km as acceptable category 3 this was based on the national coastal erosion study in 1985 conducted by the federal government to classify and mitigate erosionprone areas recognising the threats the national coastal erosion council requested the federal economic planning unit epu in 1995 to develop guidelines for erosion control in development projects this led to the formulation of the guidelines on erosion control for development projects in the coastal zone which received federal cabinet approval on january 29 1997 for implementation the sabah government prioritises minimising negative environmental impacts from marine reclamation projects while ensuring socioeconomic benefits within a sustainable framework to achieve this the sabah environment tourism development science and technology ministry in collaboration with did and the town and regional planning department trpd implemented an overarching shoreline management plan smp this plan designates areas for development and conservation along the west coast stretching from ambong bay in the north to menggalong river in the south to further standardise environmental safeguards terms of reference tor for detailed environmental impact assessment for marine reclamation were formulated to ensure environmental impact assessment eia compliance for marine reclamation project approvals additionally supporting tors for environmental monitoring and management of marine reclamation projects provide guidelines for sustainable coastal development did sabah works closely with its federal counterpart for the planning and designing of coastal erosion control river mouth improvement works and the cleaning of recreational beaches as well as collection and dissemination of data related to coastal engineering did malaysia with coordination from did sabah has carried out three feasibility study projects by consultant for three areas namely tinagatbatu puyong near tawau tungku near lahad datu and tanjong arukinarut coastal zone near kota kinabalu which are classified as catergory 1 in sabah did sabah is also working closely with other government departmentsagencies involved in coastal zone management meanwhile malaysian association of environmental health secretary rudiaswady abdul rahim in january 2024 raised concerns over the ongoing coastal erosion affecting malaysia particularly in sabah and sarawak overall malaysias 8840km coastline faces significant challenges with 13476km affected by erosion and 4313km classified as critical and significant given that the data originates from 2015 rudiaswady highlighted the urgent need for updated assessments we lack insights into the current state of coastal erosion but one thing is certain it is deeply concerning that we may be losing our beautiful beaches he warned he urged the government to conduct a comprehensive survey on coastal erosion and implement a holistic strategy incorporating naturebased solutions hybrid strategies early warning systems and investments in naturebased infrastructure to mitigate further damage jellyfish blooms linked to climate change climate change has altered the distribution patterns of sea turtles in sabah primarily due to rising sea temperatures shifting ocean currents and habitat loss dr madihah said recent observations in sabah suggest possible shifts in hawksbill turtle nesting sites for many years hawksbills have primarily nested on pulau gulisaan in turtle islands park sulu sea however a hawksbill turtle with flipper tags from turtle islands park was recently recorded nesting in semporna celebes sea this raises important questions about whether some turtles are beginning to explore alternative nesting beaches this may be linked to habitat degradation as severe erosion has impacted the main hawksbill nesting site in turtle islands park potentially forcing turtles to seek new nesting grounds she said on a global scale she said shifting nesting sites have already been documented as a response to climate change warmer temperatures are pushing certain species such as leatherbacks further north and some nesting seasons are expanding while extensive longterm monitoring is needed to confirm similar trends in sabah these local and global shifts highlight the need for conservation strategies to protect potential new nesting areas and enhance resilience against climatedriven habitat changes there has also been an increase in the sighting and frequency of mass jellyfish blooms in sabahs waters which could be an indicator of climate change she added dr madihah also noted changes in the composition abundance and size of fish species in commercial landings as evidenced by the annual fisheries statistics published by sabah fisheries department and personal field observations since the late 1990s this ecological shift is known as mesopredator release where mesopredator populations increase due to the decline of apex predators particularly large sharks and groupers however she explained that shifts in the distribution of key marine species due to climate change are not yet particularly evident the dominant coral species in sabah acropora and porites continue to thrive despite environmental changes demonstrating their resilience compared to other more vulnerable species asked about the implications for local fisheries and communities dependent on these resources dr madihah highlighted the impact of jellyfish blooms jellyfish feed on plankton including commercial fish larvae which can lead to a decline in certain fishery stocks additionally jellyfish blooms can clog fishing gear causing operational challenges for fishermen their increasing frequency also affects marine tourism particularly activities such as snorkelling and diving she explained despite these environmental changes she emphasised that ongoing conservation efforts have led to an increase in sabahs sea turtle populations as a result their shifting distribution and climaterelated changes do not yet have significant direct implications for local fisheries and communities tropical storms now lash sabah tropical storm greg devastated the state in 1996 affecting over 17000 people and destroying nearly 5000 houses while the direct marine impacts were not well documented at the time dr madihah said heavy rainfall and flooding likely contributed to increased sedimentation and pollution in coastal waters harming marine habitats similarly tropical storm hilda in 1999 caused widespread flooding and landslides particularly along the west coast like tropical storm greg the heavy rainfall would have increased runoff into coastal areas potentially harming marine habitats rising sea levels and storms due to climate change is leading to more frequent and intense storms which combined with rising sea levels exacerbate coastal erosion and threaten marine ecosystems in sabah countering fish catch decline sabahs fishing communities are facing increasing challenges as fish population declines due to climate change habitat degradation and overfishing experts warn that commercial reef fish such as grouper and snapper are becoming scarcer particularly in nonprotected reef areas based on information we get from the local fishing community commercial reef fishes like grouper and snapper are reducing said dr madihah the response has been to target less favourable species for example species that used to be not fish for food are now available in the fish market these communities are finding alternative livelihoods to adapt to declining seagrass health the fisheries department is implementing management strategies including regulating fishing activities one such is using satellite assistance called iivms to track shoals more high biodiversity and ecological important areas would also be identified and gazetted as marine parks to regulated human activities and reduce impact to marine habitats and ecosystem services the establishment of marine protected areas mpas sabah also allow seagrass and other marine life to recover,en,positive,

Why SDG13 matters to Sabah Electricity,climate change isnt a distant idea anymore it is here and its already reshaping how we live and work when people talk about climate change they often picture melting ice caps or rising sea levels in faraway places but for us at sabah electricity the effects of climate change are not distant or theoretical but they are right here on our land impacting our grid damaging our infrastructure and threatening our ability to serve the people of sabah thats why we take sustainable development goal sdg13 dedicated to climate action seriously not because its trendy or because we have to but because weve seen what happens when nature strikes and we arent prepared the truth is we need climate action not as a slogan but as a survival strategy over the past year alone weve experienced firsthand how natural disasters can paralyze the electricity supply in sabah remember the landslide in kampung nabutan that wasnt just a normal landslide as it occurred right near the 275kv transmission towers that are part of the backbone of our grid these towers connect the west coast and east coast of sabah carrying roughly 200 megawatts of electricity every day if they had fallen the entire east coast could have plunged into darkness thats not just a technical issue but also a disruption to homes schools clinics and factories thats the realworld consequence of not acting fast enough to protect our infrastructure from the shifting earth beneath our feet the condition of those towers became very critical there was no village nearby no people around to help just deep forest and unstable soil and yet 30 of our sabah electricity staff 30 from tnb and 20 contractors went deep into those highrisk areas to prevent collapse they knew the stakes they knew that for every bolt tightened every reinforcement made they were protecting the daily lives of thousands across sabah and what about the disaster in tenom on 31 october 2022 the tenom pangi hydro power station one of sabahs key sources of renewable energy was hit by a massive landslide and mud flood three turbines were damaged we lost 66 megawatts of generation capacity overnight thats clean energy gone thats a dent in our generation portfolio thats power we could not deliver to the people and again nature didnt wait for us to be ready it came in full force these are not rare events anymore they are becoming more frequent more intense and costlier toppled electric poles broken distribution lines flooded substations every time something like this happens it puts our system under stress and every time our system is under stress the people of sabah feel it whether its in the form of a blackout load shedding or delayed restoration works this is why sdg13 matters to us not as a formality but as a foundation of power stability and asset protection here in this company we see sdg13 as a lifeline when we talk about green initiatives were not just talking about planting trees or cutting carbon were talking about investing in infrastructure that survives about building systems that bend but dont break and about planning for a future where power is reliable even in the face of floods storms and landslides these things are not luxuries theyre necessities thats why for us sdg13 climate action isnt just about protecting the environment its about protecting our assets our power system and the lives and livelihoods of the people who count on us every day its easy to overlook how much the power grid depends on the land around it staying still and predictable but the earth is moving the rains are heavier the storms are stronger and sabahs geography while beautiful makes us even more vulnerable thats why sesb isnt sitting on the sidelines were reinforcing our towers upgrading our monitoring systems and doing everything we can to build resilience into our grid but beyond the technical work we also see the need to shift mindsetsours our partners and the publics climate change isnt just the responsibility of scientists and ngos its everyones problem and in our case its directly linked to whether homes have light hospitals have power and industries keep moving if we want to keep the lights on we have to care about the earth were standing on so yes sabah electricity supports sdg13 fully not because someone told us to but because weve seen what happens when we dont the path forward means embracing sustainability in real practical ways not only for the environment but for the future of electricity in sabah,en,negative,

Sabah aims to turn elephants from nuisance to tourism treasure,tourism culture and environment minister datuk seri christina liew wants the perception of elephants being seen as a source of conflict and nuisance to be shifted to being recognised as an asset for the states tourism environment and heritage accordong to her sabah is home to the smallest elephant in the world a species found nowhere else on earth while this unique trait makes them a valuable tourism asset their existence is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and humanwildlife conflict today as we gather to discuss and develop strategies for their conservation we have an opportunity to ensure that future generations will continue to witness these gentle giants roaming our forests she said at the launch of the captive elephant management plan and bornean elephant conservation symposium on wednesday i believe the discussions being held in this symposium are vital in shaping the future of bornean elephants we need to strike a delicate balance  one that allows for both the welfare of our people in sabah and the conservation of elephants to coexist in harmony we must aim for solutions where both communities and elephants benefit we have seen successful examples of turning environmental challenges into opportunities the transformation of sea turtle egg collection into a thriving hatcherybased tourism product is a prime example can we do the same for elephants can we shift the perception of elephants from being seen as a source of conflict and nuisance to being recognised as an asset to our tourism environment and heritage she asked the reality is that humanelephant conflict exists however liew said instead of seeing it as a burden all parties must explore ways to turn this challenge into a positive impact for local communities she added communitybased conservation ecotourism initiatives and compensation schemes are some avenues worth exploring at the same time we must strengthen enforcement to protect our elephants poaching and illegal killings must be met with strict prosecution to deter future offences snare traps the silent killer of our wildlife must also be eradicated this requires increased patrolling active removal of traps and harsher penalties for offenders only through decisive action and unwavering commitment can we ensure true protection for our wildlife not just for bornean elephant she added liew also said that the captive elephant management plan represents a significant step forward in improving the standards of elephant care in sabah it is also one of the key outputs of the bornean elephant action plan reinforcing commitment to ensure best exsitu practices for elephant management and longterm conservation efforts our goal is clear  we want our captive facilities such as the bornean elephant sanctuary and lok kawi wildlife park to be recognised internationally as centres of excellence these facilities provide a haven for elephants that cannot be immediately released into the wild while also supporting rehabilitation and eventual reintroduction particularly at the bornean elephant sanctuary they play a vital role in conservation education research and sustainable tourism proper training resources and recognition for elephant keeper are essential to their work investing in better infrastructure will enhance elephant welfare and elevate the tourism experience a wellmanaged sanctuary and captive elephant centre will strengthen conservation efforts while boosting sabahs tourism appeal attracting visitors eager to support ethical wildlife conservation she said with the implementation of the captive elephant management plan and the insights gained from this symposium liew is confident that sabahs efforts in bornean elephant conservation will be taken to new heights by working together  government bodies conservationists ngos and local communities liew believed all relevent parties can create a model of conservation that will be recognised internationally let this moment serve as a commitment that we will not allow the bornean elephant to be pushed toward extinction instead let us pledge to protect preserve and coexist with these magnificent creatures for generations to come she concluded also present at the event were the ministrys permanent secretary datuk josie lai director of the sabah wildlife department mohd soffian abu bakar elephant conservation lead oregon zoo dr sharon s gleaser and president of malaysian association of zoological parks and aquaria mazpa dr kevin lazarus,en,positive,
Transforming Sabah’s agricultural landscape through engineering,padi cultivation in sabah sabah is blessed with rich biodiversity fertile land and high annual rainfall  conditions ideal for agriculture yet like many regions balancing development with environmental and logistical challenges sabah remains partially reliant on imported food supplies currently over 60 of its food  particularly rice vegetables and meat products  is sourced externally leaving it exposed to supply chain disruptions and global price volatility however this also presents an opportunity by leveraging engineering innovation systems thinking and crosssector collaboration sabah can build a resilient sustainable and inclusive food ecosystem let us explore how engineering can support and enhance state initiatives address structural challenges and pave the way for food selfsufficiency 1 understanding the challenges in sabahs food system sabahs food sector faces a combination of environmental technical and infrastructural constraints low selfsufficiency sabah currently produces about 23 of its rice needs and relies heavily on imported meat and vegetables postharvest losses estimates suggest up to 40 of perishable crops are lost due to inadequate storage and logistics climate variability floods droughts and soil degradation increasingly affect yield stability logistical barriers mountainous terrain and remote rural settlements complicate farmtomarket connectivity traditional farming practices many farmers still use rainfed irrigation and manual tools limiting productivity these realities long acknowledged by policymakers and development agencies underscore the need for multidisciplinary engineering contributions to complement agricultural policy 2 engineeringdriven infrastructure solutions 21 road access for rural farming areas sabahs hilly geography makes road construction both critical and complex engineering solutions such as geosynthetics modular bridge systems and slope stabilization techniques can improve yearround connectivity these technologies are particularly useful in areas like pitas tenom and nabawan where improved roads can reduce crop spoilage and improve market access 22 smart irrigation and drainage building upon current irrigation programs engineers can design efficient water delivery systems  including drip irrigation gravityfed canals and solar pump systems  suited to sabahs microclimates surface drainage systems and floodretention ponds can protect lowlying paddy fields particularly in areas like kota belud integrated water resource management is key to resilience 23 cold chains and agroprocessing solarpowered cold storage units using phase change materials pcms along with decentralized processing hubs can help reduce postharvest losses in perishable products mechanical and process engineers can work with local cooperatives to install modular rice mills cassava dryers and fish processing units  boosting rural incomes and value addition 3 smart and sustainable agricultural engineering 31 precision farming technologies datadriven agriculture is the future agricultural engineers and software developers can implement  iot soil sensors to monitor moisture temperature and nutrients  drone surveillance with multispectral imaging to detect crop stress and pests  gis mapping for precision application of water and fertilizer such approaches improve yields while reducing environmental impacts  initiatives already piloted in districts like ranau and kundasang 32 renewable energy for agricultural applications sabah has significant renewable energy potential offgrid farms in interior regions can benefit from  solar pv systems for irrigation and refrigeration  biogas units converting animal waste into energy and organic fertilizers  microhydro systems using highland streams for electricity generation engineering expertise is needed to design hybrid systems with appropriate load management battery storage and safety measures 33 climateresilient agroinfrastructure engineering can help farms withstand extreme weather  floodcontrol infrastructure eg culverts bunds retention ponds can safeguard farmland  salttolerant greenhouses and elevated aquaponics systems protect against sealevel rise and waterlogging  slopestabilized planting terraces help retain soil in erosionprone zones designing such systems requires close integration of hydrology structural engineering and local environmental data 4 enhancing food supply chains through technology 41 blockchain and traceability blockchain systems combined with qrcoded packaging can trace food origins support halal and organic certifications and ensure quality this benefits both farmers and consumers such platforms should be mobilefriendly and available in local languages to improve adoption 42 aibased smart logistics floodprone and rural zones can benefit from aidriven logistics systems that use weather data road conditions and realtime transport tracking during the 2021 floods similar systems rerouted critical supplies successfully developing such tools in collaboration with disaster agencies and farmer cooperatives enhances preparedness and resilience 5 overcoming implementation barriers engineeringbased transformation requires an enabling environment key challenges include  financing and investment engineering projects are capitalintensive publicprivate partnerships ppps development funds and asean or unbacked grants can help scale up pilots  skills and talent development institutions like universiti malaysia sabah ums and local polytechnics can expand agritech and agriengineering courses blending agriculture with data science energy and design  communitycentric design technology must fit local needs engineers should conduct participatory rural appraisals and engage local communities to codesign solutions 6 policy recommendations to accelerate progress to support food system modernization in alignment with sabahs development goals policymakers may consider 1 integrating engineering into rmk plans prioritize agriculturelinked infrastructure and technology in sabahs development roadmaps 2 incentivizing green and smart farming offer fiscal incentives eg tax breaks green loans for businesses deploying renewable energy or agritech systems 3 forming multisectoral task forces link engineers farmers ngos academics and civil service units in coordinated project teams for infrastructure planning and monitoring conclusion engineering is not just about infrastructure  it is a bridge between technology sustainability and livelihoods in sabah engineering can reinforce the state governments goals by reducing food import dependency enhancing rural resilience and building a futureready agricultural sector from slopestabilized roads to solarcooled storage droneassisted farming to blockchain supply tracking engineering offers a practical scalable path forward with the right investments and inclusive partnerships sabah can transform its agricultural landscape  securing not only its food but the wellbeing of its

Sabah urged to assert carbon sovereignty as Federal Climate Bill looms,abah as malaysias largest carbon sink plays a critical role in the nations climate goals with the federal climate change bill rang undangundang perubahan iklim or ruupin soon to be tabled in parliament the question of sabahs carbon sovereignty and rights has become urgent at a recent briefing and dialogue convened by the civil society coalition carbon sovereign sabah css a group of elected state representatives were encouraged to act in the states best interest we are entrusting you to find ways to act for sabah and sabahs sovereignty cynthia ong of land empowerment animals people leap shared that ruupin is being fasttracked for tabling this june in the meantime sabahs state legislative assembly dun has yet to deliberate on its own climate enactment which would affirm state jurisdiction over carbon within its lands and waters in accordance with the malaysia agreement 1963 ma63 and the federal constitution the rapid pace of climate legislation at the federal level requires immediate clarity and action from sabahs leadership a proactive approach can safeguard the states valuable carbon resources and economic future css acknowledged the federal governments commitment to addressing climate change through ruupin especially in light of the increasing climate risks in southeast asia and the global shift toward loweremission trade requirements ruupin also supports malaysias obligations under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc however the coalition emphasised that efforts risk fragmentation and undermining national climate commitments without genuine consultation and strategic harmonisation with sabah datuk darrel webber sabahs climate change advisor was invited by css to provide a technical overview of the issues at stake he explained that the state had undertaken its own assessment of emissions and sinks using the same methodology applied in the federal governments unfccc submissions under the paris agreement the analysis confirmed that the state functions as a net carbon sink due to sabahs longstanding commitments to forest conservation avoidance of coal and moderate industrial activity sabahs forests significantly offset emissions of other regions and contribute the most significant share to malaysias overall greenhouse gas absorption in light of this any future frameworks to tax emissions or reward sequestration must recognise sabahs contributions and stewardship of these resources participants also reflected on historic concerns related to earlier federal legislation such as the 1974 petroleum development act pda which had implications for sabahs resource management drawing from these past experiences css encouraged the attending elected representatives  across political affiliations  to help ensure that transparent inclusive and forwardlooking processes are in place to safeguard sabahs longterm rights and interests the event demonstrated the strength of multipartisan collaboration in addressing climate governance effectively and equitably discussions at the session also acknowledged the significant progress already made in drafting sabahs climate enactment such legislation could provide the framework for responsible carbon stewardship while aligning with national climate objectives as one of the few jurisdictions globally identified as a net sink sabah is wellpositioned to play a leadership role in the emerging lowcarbon economy tungku assemblyman assaffal panglima alian who attended the session later posted on social media that sabahs rights and its sovereignty should be a priority to defend echoing this view senator datuk nelson wences angang emphasised the need for active statefederal collaboration to protect sabahs rights the intention of the federal government to table the climate change bill in the next parliamentary sitting is laudable but it is vital for them to engage actively and sincerely with the state government of sabah regarding the contents of the bill this ensures that the states perspectives needs and rights are considered and respected leading to more effective policies at the same time the sabah government must declare its stand on the bill ensuring that none of sabahs rights and privileges are affected or taken away moyog assemblyman datuk darell leiking also attended the gathering and emphasised the importance of vigilance the session revealed yet another potential timeline in which sabah risks missing the forest for the trees the state government must ensure sabah is not subjected to the unintended negative consequences of the upcoming national climate change bill especially where our sovereignty is concerned we must act now to safeguard sabah dr robecca jumin wwfmalaysias head of conservation for sabah noted the significance of sabahs legislative progress a robust legislative framework is essential to ensure sabahs progress in conserving its natural resources continues hand in hand with sustainable economic development sabahs forest carbon law put in place through the recent amendment of the forest enactment

New bill strengthens protection of Sabah forests,the sabah state legislative assembly has passed the forest enactment amendment bill 2025 aimed at reinforcing forest protection efforts while positioning the state to participate meaningfully in the global carbon market assistant minister to the chief minister datuk abidin madingkir who tabled the bill said the amendments come at a crucial time as sabah ramps up efforts to address climate change promote sustainable forest management and ensure forestrelated revenues benefit the state directly now is the most appropriate time for us to enact specific legislation to regulate forest carbon credit trading activities to safeguard the states interests and ensure the sustainability of our forest resources he said sabah he said continues to maintain approximately 63 percent of its land area under forest cover in line with the national commitment to preserve at least 50 percent of the countrys land mass under forest cover additionally under the sabah forest policy 2018 the sabah state government remains committed to its policy of gazetting no less than 30 percent of the states total land area as totally protected areas tpas to ensure sufficient coverage for environmental protection and enhancement of ecosystem services this effort aligns with sabahs commitment to address climate change issues realise the sustainable development goals sdgs and contribute to malaysias national commitments under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc cop26 and the un global biodiversity framework sabah is not exempt from facing international concerns regarding climate change and forest degradation as raised in various global conventions such as the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the convention on biological diversity cbd considering this and in response to the state governments concern for enhancing forest protection and addressing global environmental challenges the forest enactment amendment bill 2025 has been drafted to introduce specific provisions including regulating forestbased carbon activities granting authority to the chief conservator of forests to close parts of forest reserves empowering the imposition of fees and the issuance of permits and matters related thereto according to abidin article 742 of the federal constitution grants the state government the authority to enact laws relating to forests and at the national level the federal government is expected to introduce a climate change act this year therefore to ensure that the trade of forest carbon credits falls under the jurisdiction of the state government this bill must be passed without delay now is the most appropriate time for us to enact specific legislation to regulate forest carbon credit trading activities to safeguard the states interests and the sustainability of forest resources he said abidin told the state assembly that carbon stored in trees has already been defined as forest produce through the amendment of section 2 of the forest enactment 1968 in 2013 as such any benefits derived from forest carbon credit trading should rightfully benefit sabah there is a need to establish specific mechanisms to regulate forest carbon activities including international trading to ensure that sabahs rights remain protected through this amendment forest carbon activities within forest reserves state land and alienated land will be licensed according to agreed terms and conditions that safeguard the states interests with this legislation in place any provisions funds and revenues obtained from this initiative will be channelled directly to the state this is crucial in supporting the sabah governments efforts to strike a balance between conservation revenue generation and ensuring sustainable development for the state in the future he stressed the bill also introduces stiffer penalties for forestrelated offences under the forest enactment 1968 those found guilty of causing forest fires could face up to 10 years in prison or fines of up to rm500000 for illegal logging or unauthorised felling of trees in forest reserves or on state land the maximum fine has been raised to rm5 million with jail terms ranging from two to 20 years these amendments are in line with the national forestry act amendment 2022 and will enhance enforcement while promoting responsible forest stewardship said abidin the new sections introduced under the bill 12a through 12e grant the chief conservator of forests the power to declare temporary closures of forest reserves to facilitate better management and protection a new section 24e empowers the chief conservator or any authorised officer to issue permits for activities otherwise prohibited under section 201 of the enactment  except for those specified under subparagraph 201aii these provisions will ease the issuance of permits for essential forestrelated activities such as building infrastructure in accordance with forest management needs he explained additionally an amendment to section 24c is proposed to require holders of any licence or forest reserve management agreement licence to pay an annual forest rental fee to the sabah government this measure is intended to strengthen licensees commitment to managing forest reserves under the concept of sustainable forest management and is also expected to contribute to the states revenue this bill consists of 16 clauses as outlined below clause 1 provides the short title and the commencement date of the proposed enactment clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the enactment to include the definition of permit clause 3 introduces new sections 12a 12b 12c 12d and 12e empowering the chief conservator of

Address gaps in laws to protect environment,addressing the gaps in legislation that allow for unsustainable practices is necessary said chief judge of sabah and sarawak tan sri abdul rahman sebli he said that advocating for policies that ensure environmental conservation is also a must it is vital for us to recognise the importance of preserving this beautiful landscape for generations to come abdul rahman said when launching the borneo rainforest law conference at the sabah international convention centre sicc here on monday he suggested more stringent laws on environmental threats citing sabah an ecological haven that continued to face environmental threats even in this ecological haven sabah we are witnessing the impacts of environmental challenges that require our focused legal attention he said earlier in his speech abdul rahman commended on sabahs lush rainforests which is endowed with an incredible diversity of plant and animal species some of which are endemic to this region the towering dipterocarp trees vibrant orchids  known as the gold of kinabalu and unique pitcher plants create an intricate tapestry that is unparalleled the majestic mount kinabalu a unesco world heritage site stands as a testament to sabahs natural beauty harbouring a multitude of endemic species in its diverse ecosystems he said he invited those present to delve into the intricate legal landscape concerning environmental issues in malaysia and the commonwealth countries as well as on sabah and her unique geographical features including the famed salt trail within the depths of the crocker range it has been said that sabahs history can be traced along the salt trail of the crocker range this centuryold 34km passage between inobong and kampung tikolod links some of the most traditional dusunic hamlets between penampang and the interior tambunan cutting across the primeval mountain range and highland tropical rainforests of sabah the trail was once used as a route by villagers to easily access town markets with their fresh produce and return with salt and other goods he said he added that until today the salt trail remains the accessible route to remote villages especially in the upper papar river and tambunan area natural wonders like the crocker range contribute significantly to the rich biodiversity and cultural heritage of sabah nestled on the island of borneo sabah boasts a breathtaking array of flora and fauna making it a global biodiversity hotspot he said abdul rahman added that he had the opportunity to embark on the salt trail adventure last year and described it as an unforgettable experience i gained a deep appreciation for the lush forest and the rich culture of the indigenous people in sabah despite its challenges the adventure would not disappoint those seeking a unique borneo experience in its famous rainforest environment he said unfortunately the impacts of environmental challenges that require focused legal attention were also witnessed in this ecological haven he said citing the report on the sabah biodiversity conservation project identification of potential protected areas  crocker range foothill the tourism culture and environment ministry has identified various threats to biodiversity conservation in the crocker range the major threats to conservation efforts include commercial logging in state and alienated land outside the crocker range park illegal logging within the crocker range park and fires he said at the same time poaching habitat loss and humanwildlife conflict pose significant threats to iconic species such as the bornean orangutan pygmy elephant and the sumatran rhinoceros he said to safeguard their future stringent legal measures are imperative legal frameworks must be enhanced to deter illegal wildlife trade and ensure the preservation of sabahs charismatic fauna for future generations he stressed meanwhile sabahs marine biodiversity characterised by vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life faces threats from overfishing habitat destruction and climate change he said legal practitioners and marine experts are encouraged to advocate for robust legislation to safeguard marine ecosystems promoting sustainable fishing practices and marine conservation efforts he urged abdul rahman stressed that environmental protection is paramount and must not be neglected in any context in his speech he also said that climate change presents a global crisis that demands a unified response and malaysia is not exempt from its impacts he stressed that it is imperative for the legal framework to adapt and evolve to confront the challenges posed by climate change this entails promoting renewable energy sources incentivizing energy efficiency measures and integrating climate resilience into urban planning and development regulations he said and within commonwealth countries historical environmental injustices have disproportionately impacted vulnerable communities he said in addressing the impact of environmental justice on constitutional law within the commonwealth we have to find common ground in the pursuit of equitable and inclusive legal frameworks he said he urged commonwealth nations to unite in their commitment to protect the environment the ancient principles of the public trust doctrine ptd deeply ingrained in the constitutional fabric of many commonwealth countries underscore the obligation to safeguard natural resources for the benefit of all citizens the ptd has been recognized by english courts since at least 1299 establishing that the state has a fiduciary duty to safeguard vital natural resources and hold them in trust for the benefit of both current and future generations it enshrines the right for people to fish gather food and navigate our shared tidal waters he reminded he also said that collaboration between the legal community government bodies and nongovernmental organizations is paramount in addressing these issues we must work together to streamline and strengthen existing environmental laws ensuring that they are comprehensive uptodate and effectively enforced this collaboration should extend to educating the public about environmental rights and fostering a sense of responsibility towards our planet he said abdul rahman added that we have a duty to champion the cause of environmental conservation both in malaysia and within the commonwealth countries our legal system must serve as a bulwark defence against environmental degradation providing a solid foundation for sustainable development let us come together raise our voices and actively contribute to a legal landscape that safeguards our environment for future generations the time to act is now and our commitment to this cause will shape the environmental legacy within the commonwealth countries for years to come present were deputy chief justice of papua new guinea ambeng kandakasi justice brian j preston chief judge of the land and

Blu Hope to reverse environmental damage in Sabah,what happens to sabahs biodiversity will determine the fate of the rest of the planet in the future this state located on the east coast of borneo is arguably one of the most precious pieces of real estate biodiversitywise left on the planet such a status means that any inspired action taken to help reverse its slow but sure death would make a huge difference anywhere else across the world as the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt lives and economies humans are now forced to rethink their relationship with biodiversity find innovative solutions and make a pledge to heal our criticallyill planet the sabah plastic neutral platform that is led and promoted by blu hope embraces this aspiration and sets up the start of a tenyear journey toward pushing for the planets steady recovery while both sabah and timorleste pledged to move forward towards plastic neutrality it is not just about addressing the problem with plastic pollution a lot of what is happening on the ground will be the key factors that drive change particularly in terms of peoples mindset and habits blu hope is ever determined to connect all the dots  from people in positions of power who make decisions down to ordinary individuals on the ground working toward making change happen and bring real tangible shared value from plastic waste to all sabahans and timorese since sabah plastic neutrals launching in march this year the movement has seen two important events happening the first when the state government through the kota kinabalu city hall agreed to collaborate to reduce plastic waste in and around the city with the government on board blu hope is now in the position of strength and what will follow is a major cleanup campaign of plastic waste with the help among others from island communities of pulau gaya  just outside capital kota kinabalu there is no date fixed yet for the project as the pandemic has forced everyone under strict lockdown at the moment the second event is the signing of partnership with a norwegian company vow bringing french technology from etia into sabah that would turn waste to energy when this happens it will mark yet another important milestone as plastic waste will no longer be disposed in the landfill but will now be converted into green energy the biggest potential game changer however is blu hopes proposed digital recycling equaliser app called rewild  offering the opportunity for everyone to profit from recycling their own waste the world over by working with key fmgc companies rewild users will be able to scan the bar code of each product using their smart phone linking to each plastic products market value correlating to its volume and polymer type after the waste has been collected or deposited at recycling centres the app user will be rewarded financially via various payment mechanisms whats more users will also have an option to donate rewards to ngos focussed on communities and protecting sabahs unique biodiversity via sabah plastic neutral too with plastic waste soon to have a monetary value  this will mean extra food on the table  in turn incentivising the biggest and quickest clean up of sabahs local environment ever says blu hope founder simon christopher essentially this is about value just as covid is now forcing us to reasses natures intrinsic value to our very own survival by combining value from peoples waste with significantly increased recycling efforts locally will be a great way to drive change as quickly as possible even better  those comfortable enough to feed their families each and every day in other parts of the world will also have the option to directly benefit sabahan communities on the ground an ongoing basis too this is the equaliser effect and our goal with rewild is to help catalyse a global circular economy starting with sabah and timorleste says simon blu hope is not only fighting plastic pollution it connects and empowers other initiatives serving the greater good for the environment and biodiversity partnering up with specialist french waterpurifier manufacturer fonto de vivo and working closely with sabah education department their upcoming water is life program promises to deliver reliable safeclean drinking water to all schools across sabah as well as removing peoples reliance on plastic bottles utilising superengaging education and awareness programmes with sir david attenborough and fun plastic detectives activities produced by plastic oceans uk with wellknown actress and environmentalist maya karin narrating in malay the aim is to trigger behaviour change in the home starting with school children blu hope are also working closely with stop fish bombing malaysia to help solve the very serious issue of fish bombing by providing alternative livelihood programmes from plastic collection seaweed farming etc too these initiatives are just the beginning what blu hope foresees is that all the local initiatives in sabah that are working on conservation and biodiversity protection be it at land or sea would connect with one another forming a single mission the big picture that is expected to steadily grow over the first few years of this decade is that blu hopes success in sabah and timorleste will steadily expand out to other locations in the coral triangle the worlds most important marine biodiversity region with these local initiatives combined blu hope will be launching their coral triangle plastic neutral platform today officially coral triangle day  a move that would hopefully lead to the rest of the world to buy in and adopt what has been started in sabah in their own back yard and sabah and timor leste both aiming to become plastic neutral is also hoped to take centre stage at expo dubai 2021 boasted to be the worlds biggest fair bringing people of different nationalities to share ideas and build relationships as well as celebrating a world of interdependence for blu hope this will be the stage to send a strong message about how sabah and timorleste as the two last bastions of biodiversity on the planet have both taken all the right initiatives starting with plastic to rebuild a world where all species are indeed interdependent on one another another key message leading to that global event and throughout the rest of unesco decade of ocean science for sustainable development 20212030 has been that the health of the planets biodiversity rests in the hands of the younger generation blu hopes dotconnecting effort starting in sabah is hoped to be passed down to the worlds younger generation for in them lies the hope for change blu hopes inspiration inpart comes from legendary naturalists sir david attenborough and herroyaldeepness dr sylvia earles words of wisdom and through blu hope youth its mission critical we pass the baton down to younger generations equally with blu hope life well embrace the needs of

Surviving climate change in Borneo,one thing that grabbed my attention during our recent trip to national science centre in early january was a map see figure that illustrated the expected sea level rise by 2100 projected by national hydraulic research institute nahrim it shows that for malaysia the east coast of sabah  from kudat to tawau  will be the area that experiences the highest sea level rise ranging between 04 to 11 metres with an average of about 05 metres especially the southeastern area bordering north kalimantan has some of the darkest red dots three weeks later i was in tawau the city is surrounded by the sulu sea to the east and the celebes sea to the south established in the 1890s by the british it was destroyed during world war 2 but was later rebuilt according to the census 2020 report the urban area is now home to nearly 290000 inhabitants however outside the city the population is relatively small with only about 84000 people scattered throughout the district most areas in the district are planted with oil palm except the city and the tawau hills park as a border district tawau serves as the gateway to kalimantan with international ferry services connecting it to nunukan of north kalimantan the downtown area facing cowie bay may be particularly vulnerable to the rise in sea level physical infrastructure such as buildings ports roads sewage discharge facilities power lines and others could suffer damage from seawater intrusion or even be inundated the coastal region is also home to many tawau residents with numerous water villages consisting of houses built on seawater lining up from east to west these residents are among the most affected if the water level continues to increase by the end of the century large swaths of lowlying land could also be engulfed by the sea the effects of sealevel rise resulting from climate change are not limited to artificial borders and are expected to impact the indonesian counterparts as well from tawau to nunukan large tracts of mangrove forests can be found along the coast coastal erosion due to the changes in currents and waves will bring devastating impacts on coastal ecosystems in addition to physical alterations salt contamination of freshwater aquifers by seawater intrusions may also greatly damage flora and fauna destroying habitats for both lives on land and below water changes in soil and water properties can be harmful to agriculture causing cropland degradation and reducing productivity however the threat of climate change to borneo can be insidious unlike its northern neighbour ie the philippines borneo is fortunate to stay outside the general range of cyclones however the increasing frequency and severity of flood events across the island have reminded people about the potential impacts of climate change and sea level rise there were numerous reports of flash floods across borneo in 2022 with unusually heavy rainfalls cited as a main cause to make things worse land cover changes considerably exacerbate the flood risks by mapping flood events across kalimantan a group of researchers j a wells and the team in their paper published in 2016 found that flood frequency was associated with land use activities like logging and mining in contrast the villages in more forested watersheds were found to have a lesser flood risk things can also go the other way  droughts and fires droughts in borneo have become more intense in the past decades the uncontrolled fire events were made worse becoming much larger and longer due to el niñosouthern oscillation the most recent massive fire event occurred in 2015 mainly in central kalimantan causing enormous economic loss up to billions of us dollars in the event of a worstcase scenario the inhabitants of the central area of borneo may need to brace themselves for a temperature increase of approximately 4 degrees celsius by the conclusion of the 21st century this elevated temperature could have severe consequences for public health including heat waves that may endanger vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children additionally the risk of fire could be exacerbated by the rise in temperature several solutions have been proposed to combat climate change some coastal cities have opted for adaptation measures such as constructing seawalls replanning roads and planting mangroves in order to enhance their resilience to environmental changes meanwhile countries have implemented a variety of energy and industrial policies to mitigate climate change and reduce emissions however many of these approaches face challenges due to their high costs and peoples reluctance to alter their lifestyles and behaviors one potential area where borneo can make a significant contribution is by reducing and preventing greenhouse gas emissions through its abundant natural capital borneo plays a major role in global emission dynamics due to its substantial terrestrial carbon stocks proper and sustainable management of land use activities particularly agricultural expansion and mining will be an immediate priority for borneo in tackling climate change the urgency of the climate crisis presents an opportunity to bring together various stakeholders to achieve a sustainable transformation of borneos economy which is currently heavily reliant on primary resource extraction however attaining this objective requires clear and concise vision from decisionmakers we will certainly find solutions to these problems i was surprised by my 7yearolds optimism how my big ask dont know but we will when we run the world while the early 21st century was marked by great innovation and exciting developments it was also a time of global chaos and widespread anxiety as i stared out of my hotel room window the disturbing scenes from netflix shows  destruction pollution and conflict  flashed through my mind i hope that the world we leave behind for the next generation is not too bleak dr goh chun sheng is a researcher at sunway university and harvard university he is interested in exploring sustainable development in both malaysian and indonesian
